## 11.1.1 Penetration Testing

### Penetration Testing 00:00-00:35

With the rise in cybercrime, organizations need to make sure that their computer and network systems are kept completely safe. One important element of this process is to have penetration tests performed. Penetration tests, also known as pen tests or ethical hacking, are authorized simulated cyberattacks on an organization's systems.

In this lesson, we'll look at the different types of penetration tests, security teams, necessary documentation, and the steps a penetration tester needs to follow for adequate testing.

### Types of Penetration Tests 00:35-02:26

The purpose of a penetration test is to discover any vulnerabilities that exist in a network. This is done by simulating an internal or external cyberattack. There are different types of test we can perform to simulate each of these scenarios.

The first is a white box test. With this test, the pen tester is given full knowledge of the network, computer systems, and infrastructure. The white box test allows for a comprehensive and thorough testing of the environment. But it isn't the most realistic simulation as it's rare that a hacker has all the information about a system in their possession.

Next is the black box test. A black box test means that the ethical hacker has no information about the target network. This type of test is best for simulating an external attack and generally ignores internal-threat scenarios. The major drawback to this type of test is that it takes more time and is much more expensive due to the resources that go into the reconnaissance and scanning phases.

The final type of test is the gray box test. This test simulates an attack from an internal threat, like a disgruntled IT staffer. The ethical hacker is given partial information about the network such as IP configurations, email lists, computer names, and other information an insider would realistically have.

A more obscure testing procedure we'll touch on briefly is called a bug bounty. Bug bounties are programs set up by organizations such as Google, Facebook, or other large social media sites. These organizations set strict guidelines for ethical hackers to operate within to find specific vulnerabilities in their websites or apps. Often there's a monetary reward from the corporation for the individual hacker who can uncover one or more of these vulnerabilities.

The ethical hacker submits a report and is paid based on the severity of the discovered vulnerability.

### Security Teams 02:26-02:35

When performing penetration tests, you can be assigned to a team based on your role. Red, blue, purple, and white are the more common team types.

### Red Team vs. Blue Team 02:35-02:50

Red teams are the ethical hackers. This team is responsible for performing attacks on the network within the stated guidelines. The blue team is responsible for defending against the red team. These teams work together to find and secure any network vulnerabilities.

### Purple Team 02:50-02:59

The purple team is a combination of the red and blue team. This team doesn't focus on one side but instead takes both offensive and defensive postures.

### White Team 02:59-03:25

The white team is responsible for managing the engagement between the red and blue team. This group consists of the managers or team leads. You can think of them as the referees of cybersecurity.

Selecting the appropriate type of penetration test allows the organization to find the most egregious security flaws in their network. It's important that the pen testers strictly adhere to the type of pen testing guidelines agreed on beforehand.

### Penetration Testing Goals 03:25-03:34

Before any testing can begin, the goals and guidelines need to be established. These are all spelled out in the Rules of Engagement and Scope of Work documents.

### Scope of Work 03:34-05:22

The Scope of Work is a very detailed document that defines exactly what is to be included in the penetration test. This document is also referred to as the Statement of Work.

It should answer the who, what, when, where, and why of the test. The how is defined in the Rules of Engagement.

The Scope of Work should clearly define who's being tested. Specific IP address ranges, servers, applications, and other network devices are explicitly listed.

The purpose of this section is for the organization to specify if certain devices are off limits. A pen tester is breaking the law if he or she accesses anything not specified in the Scope of Work.

Once it's been decided what exactly can be tested, a timeframe for deliverables should be established. Not only should this define how long the test will go on for, but it should also define what deliverables are and at what intervals they should be delivered. For example, it may be agreed on that weekly reports and updates are to be given until the end of the test.

If the organization has offices in different states, or if the pen tester works in a different state, everyone needs to agree beforehand on which state laws are going to be adhered to.

The goal of the test needs to be defined as well. If the test is compliance based, that fact needs to be specifically spelled out. All parties need to agree on what the end goal or acceptable results of the test will be.

Any special considerations like travel, work requirements, certifications, or unexpected scenarios needs to be stated and planned for to the degree possible.

Finally, the Scope of Work should define payment. In this section, the parties agree on how to handle additional work that may be requested. This helps to reduce scope creep. Both parties should have lawyers review the documentation and then sign off on it.

### Rules of Engagement 05:22-05:46

The Scope of Work defines what work will be done. The Rules of Engagement defines exactly how that work will be carried out.

The Rules of Engagement states whether the test will be a white box, gray box, or black box test. It should also explicitly state how to handle sensitive data. If something unexpected happens during the test and the IT team needs to be notified, that process should also be laid out in this document.

### Penetration Testing Lifecycle 05:46-08:02

Once the paperwork has been finalized, the pen testers get to work. There are five phases to the penetration testing lifecycle. These are reconnaissance or footprinting, scanning and enumeration, gaining access, maintaining access, and reporting.

The first step in the hacking process is reconnaissance, also known as footprinting. In this phase, the hacker begins gathering information on their target. This can include gathering publicly available information, using social engineering techniques, or even dumpster diving.

The second step is scanning the target. It's at this point that the hacker is actively engaged with the target. Scanning is really a natural extension of reconnaissance. The hacker uses various tools to gather in-depth information on the network, computer systems, live systems, open ports, and other targets.

Extracting information such as usernames, computer names, network resources, shares, and services is known as enumeration. Enumeration is part of the scanning step.

The third step is where the real fun begins! This is when the hacker takes all the information gathered through their reconnaissance and scanning and exploits any vulnerabilities they found in order to gain access to the target.

Once the pen tester gains system access, he or she can use that initially penetrated device to gain even deeper access to the network. This is known as making lateral moves, or pivoting.

Usually, the first access is regular-user access without many privileges. One of the hacker's goals is to gain administrator-level access. This is known as privilege escalation. Depending on the environment, the hacker can use appropriate methods to gain access to a higher-level account.

Once the hacker has gained access, maintaining that access becomes the next priority. This can be done by installing backdoors, rootkits, or Trojans. Once the hacker has permanent access to the system, he or she can use it to launch more attacks.

The pen tester should also make sure to clear their tracks just like a real-world hacker would. While this isn't part of the penetration testing lifecycle, it's an obvious best practice.

The final step is documentation. After any penetration test, a detailed report must be compiled. Documentation is extremely important protection for the penetration tester and the organization.

### Summary 08:02-08:35

That'll wrap up this lesson. In this lesson we covered the different types of penetration tests, which include white, black, and grey box tests. We looked at the different teams involved with security, such as the offense-focused red team, the defense-focused blue team, as well as the purple and white teams.

We also covered the important documentation that defines the goals and rules of the test. Finally, we went over the important pen tester process known as the penetration testing lifecycle.

    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>Red team</td>
        <td>
        The red team members are the ethical hackers. This team is responsible for performing the penetration tests.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Blue team</td>
        <td>
        Blue team members are the defense of the system. This team is responsible for stopping the red team's advances.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>White team</td>
        <td>
        The white team members are the referees of cybersecurity. This team is responsible for managing the engagement between the red and blue teams. This group typically consists of the managers or team leads.
        </td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

### Documentation/Contracts

Before any penetration test can take place, the goals and guidelines of the test must be established. These are spelled out in the scope of work and rules of engagement documents.
The following table describes these important documents:

<table>
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th class_="firstTableHeader" scope="col" class="fw-bold">
        Document Type
        </th>

    <tr>
        <td>Scope of work</td>
        <td>
        The scope of work is a very detailed document that defines exactly what is going to be included in the penetration test. This document is also referred to as the statement of work. This document should answer the:
        <ul>
            <li>
            Who - specific IP ranges, servers, applications, etc. should be explicitly listed.
            </li>
            <li>
            What - anything that is off limits, such as specific servers or tactics, should be explicity listed.
            </li>
            <li>
            When - the time frame for the penetration test. This should identify how long the test will run, the deliverables, and when the deliverables are due.
            </li>
            <li>
            Where - the location of the penetration tester. Sometimes the penetration tester will be located in a different state. In this case, all parties must agree on which state laws will be followed.
            </li>
            <li>
            Why - the purpose and goals of the test. Penetration tests are often performed for compliance purposes and these requirements must be detailed in the document.

        </ul>
        <p>
            Special considerations, such as travel, required certifications, or anything else unexpected will be defined in the scope of work.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, the scope of work should define payment and how to handle requests for additional work. This will help to reduce scope creep.

## 11.1.3 Exploring Penetration Testing Tools

### Exploring Penetration Testing Tools 00:00-01:39

In this demonstration, we're going to look at penetration testing tools that you can use to evaluate the security of your network or a particular host on your network.

As you probably know, Linux is a very popular platform for testing network and host security. First, you need to choose a Linux distribution that you can use for penetration testing. A good place to start looking for those distributions is the DistroWatch website. Many of the Linux distributions here can be run as a live CD or installed on the hard drive. A live CD is an optical disc or a bootable USB drive that has the Linux operating system installed on it. It can also have many of the security tools you need to perform a penetration test.

Because it's installed on a USB drive or an optical disc, you can insert that into the computer and boot the system off the disc. When you do, you'll have a Linux operating system up and running with the tools you need for testing.

There are several advantages associated with testing this way. First, there's a wide variety of free penetration testing tools available for the Linux operating system, and if you're using a LiveCD, you don't have to install an operating system.

If you're booting off an optical disc, there's no way for malware or anything else to actually affect the files on the disc. There are many different distributions available. You can see their names here. You can also see the purpose of the distribution listed over here. Since we're interested in security, let's go over here and look at this one.

### Kali Linux and Parrot Linux 01:39-02:49

The most popular and well-accepted distribution for security and penetration testing is Kali Linux. Let's go ahead and click on that and see what we can learn. It tells us where the home page is and a lot of other information. I have its home page open in another tab, up here. We can read a little bit more and see what tools are actually included on this distribution. I'm going to go to the Download page. I see the latest version right here, Kali Linux 64-Bit. Over here, I can see the checksum, or hash value.

Now, I already have a copy of Kali downloaded and ready to go. We'll get to that in a minute. But I want to go back to DistroWatch. I'll go back to the previous page. I just want to point out that there's another Linux distribution called Parrot Linux. Parrot is a distribution with a collection of various utilities that are popular with penetration testers and computer forensic professionals. Here's the link to the home page, but I already have a tab opened up. Down here, you can read more about the project and learn about the different tools. Now back to Linux.

### Kali Install and Tools 02:49-03:48

My Kali Linux ISO image is downloaded, and I've booted it up. Now it's asking me now if I want to install it to disc or just use it as a LiveCD. I'll go ahead and say, "Sure, go ahead and just use it as a LiveCD."

We'll let it launch, and pretty soon, we'll see the graph called User Interface. Each Linux distribution has its own set of package tools. This one specializes in security tools.

Here are some of the tools that Kali Linux has packaged with its distribution. Over here, you'll see the Metasploit Framework Armitage (which is a graphical user interface for that framework), Burp Suite, BeEF Cross-Site Scripting Framework, and some others that we could use to do our penetration testing.

Now, obviously, we don't have time in this short video to really discuss penetration testing or even look at a specific tool in-depth, but I'll show you how you could penetration test using one of the pre-packaged tools that we can launch from a LiveCD.

### Metasploit Framework 03:48-05:22

Let's start the Metasploit Framework by clicking on it. That's going to create the database where we're going to save some of the information about hosts and other things. Once that's done, I'll go ahead and bring up Armitage, which is the graphical user interface that we can use to easily interact with the extensive commands that exist as part of the Metasploit framework.

It looks like that's launched now, and we'll go ahead and launch Armitage. There it is. We'll connect, and it asks us if we want to start the remote procedure called Server. We'll say, "Sure, that'll be great. It'll connect us up to the database." It takes just a minute to make those connections.

It looks like it made the connection, and it'll launch here shortly. We're greeted with several different windows and several different options. Essentially, what we need to do is tell Armitage (and, in conjunction, the Metasploit Framework) which hosts we want to actually try to launch an attack on. We could use an Nmap scan to import that information. We could also use the Metasploit Framework scan, which will go out and ping the different machines in a certain subnet and gather information.

In this case, I'm going to keep it simple so we don't scan all the hosts on our network, and I'll just add a single host, a vulnerable Linux virtual machine that I have on the network. I know it's on the IP ending in .102. Now click Add and then OK. It says that it added it, and we've identified a host. However, we don't have much information about it yet.

### Open Ports 05:22-05:45

But if I right-click on that host, I can scan it. Now it'll look for all the open ports, and you can see a variety of open ports that are coming up. We can also request additional information about services that might be running and on specific ports.

So you can see here that we have certain ports, but we don't know much about the services quite yet.

### MSF Scan 05:45-06:35

If we wanted to, we could try to gather some additional information. Let's do an MSF scan on that host, and that will try to identify some information about the operating system that's running on it. You'll notice that every time we run a command it launches a separate window down here, so you could go along and close these out as you go.

We know some information about this computer--some of the ports that are open, some of the services that may be running, etc. It's not a lot of data, but Metasploit keeps track of the vulnerabilities based on the ports that are open, the services that are running, the operating system that's running, and so on. You can come up here, and you can actually find attacks specific to the host that you've already discovered. We'll let it go through its database and find specific exploits that it might want to try.

### Specific Exploit 06:35-07:33

So, that's complete. Now we could go through the attack menu and look for a specific exploit. You'll see here that, based on the ports that it found, it said, "Hey, FTP's open. Go ahead and try these exploits.—

Each of these exploits will run the specific exploit when you click on them, and you have to provide specific values for the exploit. We don't actually know if any of these attacks will run, so the ability to check on that is built into the Metasploit framework. Some of the exploits have the ability to use this check; others are older and don't.

Let's try doing a check on some of these right now. It says this one doesn't support the check, this specific vulnerability is not exploitable, not exploitable, doesn't support the check, and so on. For the ones that don't support the check, we'd have to go through and try each of them individually.

### Hail Mary 07:33-08:58

Now, generally, as you're looking at an organization and trying to compromise hosts within it, you don't want to make a lot of noise or cause a lot of traffic on the network, so you try these very specific attacks based on what you discover. However, there is an option inside of Armitage (and, subsequently, Metasploit) that lets you do what's known as the Hail Mary, and that is just try out every single attachment possible. In the interest of time, rather than going through every single one of these attacks in a systematic way, we'll do the noisy attack because I want to show you how you can compromise the mission, and we'll see which vulnerabilities actually exist.

If we click on Hail Mary here, then it says, "Hey, are you sure you want to do this? There's going to be a flood of exploits, and it's kind of noisy.— We'll say yes, that's what we intend to do, and then it'll go through that database of exploits and try to run them with a variety of different payloads so that it's trying to establish a connection to that remote machine. We'll let it do its thing here for a minute.

It went through the database, and now it's launching each of those exploits. You'll see that the exploits are going to certain ports based on the services that are running on those. We'll give it another minute here, and it'll start taking advantage of some of those exploits.

### Exploit Found 08:58-10:54

Oh look, our icon changed. That means we actually have a connection. And once it made the connection, it gathered some additional information and says, "Yep, this is definitely a Linux box.— We can see what version of Linux and some other information, too.

Once we have a session, we can gather all sorts of data. We can get the dump of the passwords and the hashes associated with the passwords and then try to crack those. Maybe we compromise the accounts and get more straightforward access, but there's all of these different sessions that we could establish based on the different exploits that we just ran. Again, usually, you wouldn't do the Hail Mary because it's too noisy. But in this case, it's a quick and easy demonstration of the vulnerabilities that exist on this specific machine.

If we scroll down here, we'll see a variety of exploits that exist for this machine, and we'll give ourselves a little bit more space. You can see, as we scroll up, that it looks like there's a PHP exploit, PHP CGI injection. There's a user map, a Samba exploit, another Samba exploit, and several others that actually allowed us to have a session over to that machine.

Let's go ahead and open a new console session. I'll adjust these windows so we can see better. We can run the sessions command, and you'll see that we currently have four sessions connecting from our machine. I know that's this IP address to this vulnerable machine, right there, through PHP, and then through some command lines.

Let me go ahead and connect to one of these sessions interactively. We'll choose Session 2, and now I've got a Linux command prompt. I can do things like list the file system. I can say, —œWho am I?— If you look at the bottom here, I have root access. With that access, I could grab the hashes for the passwords. I could execute any commands. I could set up additional back doors. I could do all sorts of things.

### Summary 10:54-11:33

Penetration testing is awesome, and ultimately, we're trying to compromise systems so that we know how to lock them down. To do that, we often use these pre-packaged tools that come with the distribution. Kali Linux along with Metasploit and Armitage already pre-packaged is a fantastic tool to use for penetration testing.

That's it for this demonstration. In this demo, we talked about penetration testing tools, and then we talked about the concept of a LiveCD and looked at a couple of Linux distributions that you could download and use in your testing.
