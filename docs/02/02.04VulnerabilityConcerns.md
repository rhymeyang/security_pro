## 2.4.1 Vulnerability Concerns

### Device Vulnerabilities 00:00-00:22

Hackers often target a firm's infrastructure. Whether it's misconfigured devices, weak security configurations, default settings, outdated firmware, or other exploits, these vulnerabilities serve as a prime target for accessing valuable information. Let's discuss some of these vulnerabilities.

### Misconfigured Devices 00:22-01:17

Misconfigured devices, such as firewalls, content filters, or access points, can serve as an entry point into an organization. Firewalls that have too many ports open may allow unwanted traffic to specific programs or devices. This external access allows a wider range of potential exploitation.

If content filters are not used or misconfigured, traffic like SPAM or questionable websites with potentially malicious links or payloads may expose employees to malware attacks that lead to a loss of sensitive data.

Misconfigured access points with lax security can allow an outsider to access a corporate network as if they were a company employee. Training is essential for systems administrators and security professionals to accurately configure devices so that only approved personnel are permitted to access ports, programs, accounts, and devices.

### Weak Security Configuration 01:17-02:57

Alongside misconfigured devices, weak security configurations can also expose a company's infrastructure and data to malicious attacks. Weak configurations can be devices running old or outdated protocols. For example, an access point configured to run with WEP is an immediate security vulnerability. Another example of this is sites using SHA-1 certificates.

SHA-1 was a commonly used hashing algorithm, but now is considered insecure. In fact, many modern browsers are rejecting these certificates because of the vulnerability they pose to having presumably encrypted data intercepted and decrypted.

Perhaps there is no greater risk in the security world than systems administrators who use default settings or passwords on a device. Attackers can simply access Google to learn the default credentials to most common makes and models of devices. Once an attacker determines the make and model of a device, it's easy to compromise if a systems administrator hasn't changed the default credentials.

Many device manufacturers are now shipping devices with customized usernames and passwords, but there are still far too many devices that retain the defaults. When you install a new network device, check to see if the device has default accounts and passwords. If so, change these factory defaults.

Some default configurations also need to be altered. For instance, some access points ship without the encryption set. In general, however, the recent trend is for manufacturers to lock down or disable services and require that administrators explicitly change the factory defaults.

### Outdated Firmware 02:57-03:46

Systems administrators also need to ensure that devices have up-to-date firmware and operating systems, and that software has the latest patches. For example, in 2014, the Heartbleed bug took advantage of systems with an older version of the popular OpenSSL cryptography library.

More recently, in 2017, WannaCry ransomware ransacked the internet, holding peoples' data hostage by taking advantage of default settings in several operating systems that had SMB version 1 enabled by default. Most manufacturers release updated firmware and patches to protect against widespread vulnerabilities. However, in many cases, administrators must explicitly apply new firmware or patches to be protected.

### Hardcoded Credentials 03:46-04:29

Hard coded passwords are another infrastructure vulnerability, especially if some services share the password. If the password is the same across your devices or software, then every customer is vulnerable in a hacking situation. Additionally, hard coded passwords are often troublesome to update regularly.

Another variant of this vulnerability is when accounts are more accessible than necessary. For example, many developers use a single super user password to connect to an entire database rather than restricting portions of the database required for specific functionality. If this password is compromised, then hackers can access the complete database, rather than a subset of the data.

### Easy Physical Access 04:29-05:14

Protecting infrastructure also includes protecting physical access to individual components. If an attacker can gain physical access, typically, they can reset passwords and enter the critical systems of an infrastructure. For example, adding an administrative account on a Windows 10 server is relatively straightforward with physical access. Similarly, bypassing required passwords to access privileged mode on a Cisco router is easy if you have physical access to the device. Ensuring that only specific software and services are allowed on your infrastructure and changing the default passwords and configurations will cut down on exploits. However, if physical access to infrastructure isn't restricted, then those protections are useless.

### Zero Days and CVEs 05:14-06:16

When vendors create software or firmware for devices, it sometimes contains code that can be exploited. When these vulnerabilities are unknown to the vendor and exploited in the wild, they are referred to as zero-day vulnerabilities. Once the vulnerability is discovered and patched, the exploit is no-longer referred to as a zero-day exploit. Rather, these are called known exploits.

However, keeping track of vulnerabilities throughout their lifecycle is important. There have been a handful of initiatives to catalog and standardize names for zero-day exploits or other vulnerabilities. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures, or CVE, database is a popular repository hosted by MITRE Corporation. On this database, security professionals can download lists of known CVEs, submit new findings, and update information about an existing CVE. NIST, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, also maintains a national vulnerability database.

### Summary 06:16-06:56

In summary, an enterprise needs to protect its infrastructure and can do so by ensuring that no outdated firmware, default passwords, default configurations, or weak security settings are used. Additionally, systems administrators need to make sure that software patches are applied in a timely manner and that bad software development practices, like hard coded passwords, are avoided. Additionally, physical access is critical to securing an infrastructure. Security professionals need to be aware of the resources for cataloging and identifying common vulnerabilities and exposures.

## 2.4.2 Vulnerability Concerns Facts

A knowledgeable attacker can exploit network device vulnerabilities to gain access to network resources.

      is the process of recovering
          secret passwords from data that has been stored in or transmitted by a computer system.
      <p>
       To avoid this vulnerability enforce complex password requirements. Complex passwords are typically over eight
          characters and a mix of character types (letters, numbers and symbols). Also require that the passwords are not words,
          variations of words, or derivatives of the user name.

      <ul>
       <li>
        A user who accesses a system with a standard user account but is able to access functions reserved for higher-level
            user accounts such as administrative features.
       </li>
       <li>
        A user who is able to access content that should be accessible only by a different user.

      Cloud-based and third-party systems
     </td>
     <td>
      <p>
       When dealing with cloud-based or other third-party systems, you need to make special provisions. If an organization is
          using a cloud-based system, that means the organization doesn't own the system and cannot legally provide permission
          for a penetration test to be carried out on that system. The penetration tester must make sure to get the explicit
          permission of the cloud provider before performing any tests.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other third-party systems can cause issues for the penetration tester. If systems are interconnected, such as in a
          supply chain, the penetration tester needs to ensure they do not accidentally access the third party's systems. The
          penetration tester can also discover vulnerabilities that affect the third party. In this scenario, the penetration
          tester should report findings to the client and let the client handle the reporting.

      <p>
       The root account has all system privileges and no barriers. It is also referred to as superuser. To prevent accidental
          damage to the system, an administrator using root must precisely and expertly perform tasks on the system. Also, the
          administrator should be the only one using the root account. Because there's no safety net when using root, it's
          important to make backups of any files or directories you're working with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another danger of using root frequently is that most apps and programs have several programming errors (because of the
          amount of code required and its complexity). An attacker can find and exploit these errors to gain control of a system
          when a program runs with root privileges instead of an ordinary user account, which has very limited privileges.
      </p>
      <p>
       To avoid unnecessary risk, use the root account only when absolutely necessary. This includes experienced
          administrators. Have administrators log in with the admin account and use the su command. This command gives root
          privileges only as needed, without requiring a new login.

### Adversarial Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. AI also refers to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind, such as learning and solving problems.

Be aware of the following about Artificial intelligence (AI):

- Refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines.
- Goals include learning, reasoning, and perception.
- AI is used across different industries, including government and the private sector.
- Weak AI tends to be simple and single-task oriented, while strong AI carries on tasks that are more complex and human-like.

Adversarial Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be divided into two categories. weak and strong.

> Depending on the source, some of the examples may be listed as weak, strong, or both.

          typically complex. Strong AI include the ability to reason, make judgments, solve puzzles, learn, plan,
          and communicate. It is also sometimes referred to as Full AI.

## 2.4.3 Impact of Vulnerabilities

### Impact of Vulnerabilities 00:00-00:13

Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in networks and systems. In this video, we'll explore a few of the negative impacts of those exploits.

### Data Loss 00:13-01:11

We'll start with data loss, which is detrimental because losing files means losing time and money.

It's true that this can happen accidentally--for example, if an employee deletes data unintentionally. But many times, it's intentional and caused by a virus or malware sent out for a malicious purpose. Data loss caused by corruption or viruses is particularly problematic because it's harder to detect the extent of the loss, and it's costly for businesses to repair damaged files.

Physical damage and formatting errors can also make data unreadable by both humans and software. Losing files and documents usually has a lasting financial impact as well.

It also messes up productivity timelines and your reputation with customers. If sensitive data is stolen or compromised, this news is communicated to clients, and you'll lose their trust and respect. After recovering from the data loss, businesses always need to rebuild client relationships.

### Data Breaches 01:11-01:59

The data loss realm includes data breaches. A breach occurs when confidential or protected data is exposed. A few examples include social security numbers, bank account and credit card numbers, health information, passwords, and email.

And just as with data loss, data breach can be intentional or accidental. For example, if an attacker hacks a company's database, that's intentional. If an employee unknowingly exposes data on the internet, that's accidental. But in the end, data breach allows criminals to access sensitive information and profit from it.

As an IT administrator, you should take steps to strengthen the company's defenses against data breach. This could include many steps, such as employee education and regularly checking the network for unusual activity.

### Data Exfiltration 01:59-02:24

Speaking of data theft, I should also mention data exfiltration. This is when information or files are transferred from a computer without authorization. This can be done manually if the attacker has physical access to the computer, or it can be automated by sending out malware over a network. A common tactic attackers use for this exploit is DNS tunneling, so make sure to implement a good DNS threat analytics solution.

### Identity Theft 02:24-03:27

A related threat is Identity theft. This means an attacker tries to access information such as credentials so they can commit fraud, doing things like opening new accounts in the victim's name. Many attackers use data breaches to get the information they need.

There are several types of identity theft. First, there's criminal identity theft. This is when the attacker commits a crime using someone else's identifying information to mislead the authorities. Next, there's medical identity theft. This happens when the attacker uses someone else's insurance card for medical care or prescription drugs.

There's also tax identity theft, when the attacker files a tax return with someone else's name to steal their refund. And then there's child identity theft, when the attacker opens accounts using a child's social security number. There are others, too--these are just a few examples.

As an IT administrator, keep an eye on any unusual activity in your network. Educating the company's employees is also helpful for catching identity theft attempts.

### Availability Loss 03:27-04:02

The last vulnerability exploit I'll mention in this lesson is availability loss.

Availability means systems work promptly and service is accessible to users. So, from a security standpoint, availability loss is when an attacker performs a malicious act to make the network so busy that the system goes down, usually through malware. When this happens, employees are kept from their work or are unable to accomplish their tasks. Customers are also unable to access the company's services. This costs the company time, money, and a lot of frustration.

### Summary 04:02-04:29

As you can see, it's very important to properly secure networks against vulnerabilities. Threat actors are always on the lookout for weaknesses to exploit, and the impacts are detrimental. In this lesson, we looked at the impacts of data loss, breaches, and exfiltration. We also covered identity theft, financial loss, reputation loss, and availability loss.

## 2.4.4 Impact of Vulnerabilities Facts

It’s important to properly secure networks against vulnerabilities. Threat actors are always on the lookout to exploit vulnerabilities and the impacts can be very detrimental.

This lesson covers the topic of the impacts of vulnerabilities.

### Impacts of Vulnerabilities

Vulnerabilities in networks and systems are often exploited by attackers. Here's a few of the direct impacts successful exploitations can cause:

In addition to the direct financial impact of the exploitation, the reputation of organizations is negatively impacted. If sensitive data is stolen or compromised, this news is communicated to clients, who lose trust in and respect for the organization. Even after recovering from the data loss, businesses need to rebuild client relationships.
