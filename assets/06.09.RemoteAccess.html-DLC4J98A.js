Remote access allows a host to connect to a remote server or private network and access remote resources as if they were connected locally. Remote access connections are typically made by employees who need to connect to the office from home or while traveling.</p><p>For example, if a user were on site, they&#39;d connect to the local server using their internal network infrastructure.</p><p>Remote connections need some type of physical connection between the user and the server. In most cases, the internet provides an option for physical connectivity. In this case, the client computer connects through their DSL internet service provider to gain access to the internet, and the business is connected to the internet through their fiber internet service provider.</p><h3 id="authentication-00-51-01-09" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#authentication-00-51-01-09"><span>Authentication 00:51-01:09</span></a></h3><p>When you make a connection from the remote client to the remote access server, you first establish the physical connection. Then you need to negotiate a Data Link layer connection. To do this, you&#39;ll need to be authenticated. Let&#39;s talk about several authentication protocols used with remote access.</p><h3 id="point-to-point-protocol-01-09-01-46" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#point-to-point-protocol-01-09-01-46"><span>Point-to-Point Protocol 01:09-01:46</span></a></h3><p>The first is the Point-to-Point Protocol, or PPP. PPP is used to establish the data link connection. PPP&#39;s purpose is to identify the upper-layer protocols that the devices will use to communicate.</p><p>When the connection is first established, the devices negotiate and decide what protocols they&#39;ll use to communicate. They might also decide to use encryption or compression. During this process, the client device is assigned an IP address so that it can communicate across the network. The devices then negotiate which authentication method to use.</p><h3 id="password-authentication-protocol-01-46-02-18" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#password-authentication-protocol-01-46-02-18"><span>Password Authentication Protocol 01:46-02:18</span></a></h3><p>The next authentication protocol is the Password Authentication Protocol, or PAP. PPP uses PAP to verify users. PAP involves a very simple two-way handshake. The hostname and password are sent to the desired server, and the server either accepts or rejects access. The username and password are transmitted in plain text, so if someone captures the authentication process, they&#39;ll have access to your password and your username. Because of this, PAP isn&#39;t widely used.</p><h3 id="chap-authentication-02-18-02-49" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#chap-authentication-02-18-02-49"><span>CHAP Authentication 02:18-02:49</span></a></h3><p>Another authentication protocol is the Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol, or CHAP. CHAP is a more secure method for connecting to a remote system. Unlike PAP, the secret is never sent over the network.</p><p>Instead, CHAP uses a three-way handshake where unique challenge phrases are exchanged for authentication. This three-way handshake ensures that the same system exists throughout a communication session by repeatedly and randomly re-testing the validated system.</p><h3 id="extensible-authentication-protocol-02-49-03-20" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#extensible-authentication-protocol-02-49-03-20"><span>Extensible Authentication Protocol 02:49-03:20</span></a></h3><p>The Extensible Authentication Protocol, or EAP, is another authentication protocol that uses an ongoing authentication method like CHAP, but it&#39;s even more secure. EAP allows the client and the server to negotiate the characteristics of authentication. When a connection is established, the client and server negotiate the authentication type that will be used based on the allowed authentication types configured on each device. EAP can be configured to support multi-factor authentication.</p><h3 id="authorization-03-20-04-20" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#authorization-03-20-04-20"><span>Authorization 03:20-04:20</span></a></h3><p>After the physical connection is established, the communication parameters must be agreed upon, and then authentication can occur.</p><p>So the next step is authorization. Authorization identifies what resources the remote clients can access on the remote network. Let&#39;s see how it works.</p><p>In this example, we have a remote client that&#39;s connected to a private network through a remote access server. Authorization identifies what this user or device can access on the private network.</p><p>It may be configured so that remote clients can only access the remote access server itself, and nothing else. In this case, you would place all your shared content for remote users directly on the remote access server. If you decide to permit access to the private network, you could use authorization to restrict remote client access to only certain devices. That way, users attempting to access the network from an unrecognized device are denied access to the private network.</p><h3 id="remote-access-policies-04-20-05-56" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#remote-access-policies-04-20-05-56"><span>Remote Access Policies 04:20-05:56</span></a></h3><p>Both authentication and authorization are usually controlled by remote access policies. Remote access policies identify users who can connect and then lets them know whether the connection is allowed or denied.</p><p>For example, you might allow only certain users to use remote access. Then you might restrict those users based on the time of the day, such as only allowing them to user remote access during working hours.</p><p>You could also restrict remote access by connection type.</p><p>When the remote user connects, the remote access server checks the policies to find out what type of restrictions to apply. Then it either allows or denies access based on the information in the policies. These policies can be defined on the remote access server itself.</p><p>You would go to the server and define the policies that apply to your remote access users. In some cases, you can configure your remote access server to connect to a separate database that contains your user account information. For example, on a Microsoft network, your remote access server would use Active Directory to identify users who can connect and match users with passwords.</p><p>What happens if your company&#39;s demand for remote access grows so much that a single remote access server can no longer support all the remote clients? One solution is to install a second remote access server on the network. However, because all policies must be defined on each server, you would have to copy the policies from the first server and duplicate them to the second server. As the number of remote access servers grows, the work required to maintain all these policies also grows.</p><h3 id="aaa-server-05-56-06-50" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#aaa-server-05-56-06-50"><span>AAA Server 05:56-06:50</span></a></h3><p>Another solution is to use an AAA server. AAA stands for three parts of this remote access process; Authentication, Authorization and Accounting. We&#39;ve talked a lot about authentication and authorization, but what about accounting?</p><p>Accounting is the process of keeping track of what took place during a connection. For instance, you might need to track how long clients were connected so you can bill the department they work for based on their connection time. Accounting also includes keeping track of the connection characteristics.</p><p>With an AAA server, policies are defined once on the AAA server instead of on each individual remote access server. When an authentication request is received by any of these servers, the authentication request is forwarded to the AAA server, where the credentials and policies are consulted to determine whether access should be allowed or denied.</p><h3 id="radius-06-50-07-38" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#radius-06-50-07-38"><span>RADIUS 06:50-07:38</span></a></h3><p>There are two common solutions for providing this type of authentication mechanism. One is called RADIUS. RADIUS stands for Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service. It&#39;s a networking protocol that works on port 1812.</p><p>With a RADIUS server, authentication and authorization are combined into a single device, but accounting can be moved onto a different device. You may also decide to have a single device that provides all three functions. RADIUS uses the User Datagram Protocol, or UDP, during the authorization process.</p><p>RADIUS is used a lot in Microsoft implementations, so a Microsoft remote access solution would likely use a RADIUS server for authentication, authorization, and accounting.</p><h3 id="tacacs-07-38-09-01" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#tacacs-07-38-09-01"><span>TACACS+ 07:38-09:01</span></a></h3><p>Another solution is called TACACS+. TACACS+ separates all three functions into different services. You can combine all three services on a single physical server that provides authentication, authorization, and accounting. You can also split those services. You may have one server that performs authentication, a different server that&#39;s used for authorization, and a third used for accounting.</p><p>Another key difference between TACACS+ and RADIUS is that TACACS+ uses TCP instead of UDP, so it&#39;s more reliable. In addition, TACACS+ encrypts the entire communication session between the remote access servers and the AAA servers. It also supports protocols beside IP.</p><p>TACACS was originally developed in 1984 by BBN Technologies, but the current version of the protocol standard, TACACS+, was developed by Cisco Systems. It&#39;s supported by many vendors, such as BlueCat Networks, IBM, and Netgear.</p><p>In this configuration, the server that provides the AAA services is called the server. The remote access servers are called clients. These RADIUS clients connect to the remote access server. The remote access server forwards authentication information to the RADIUS server, which then provides the requested authentication.</p><h3 id="summary-09-01-09-24" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#summary-09-01-09-24"><span>Summary 09:01-09:24</span></a></h3><p>And that&#39;s all for this lesson.

We also discussed two remote authorization solutions, RADIUS and TACACS+.</p><h2 id="_6-9-2-remote-access-facts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_6-9-2-remote-access-facts"><span>6.9.2 Remote Access Facts</span></a></h2><p>This lesson covers the following topics:</p><ul><li> Remote access </li><li> Remote access protocols </li><li> Remote access policies </li></ul><h3 id="remote-access" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#remote-access"><span>Remote Access</span></a></h3><p>Remote access allows a host to connect to a server, or even a private network, and access resources on that remote system as if the host was connected locally.

I&#39;m going to go into my Network Policy Server Manuscript console. You can see, up here, we have a list of RADIUS clients and remote RADIUS servers. Whoever&#39;s talking to RADIUS needs to be configured as a RADIUS client. The only exception is if RADIUS is installed on the same server as Remote Access, which is actually the case in my environment. You can see, over on the left-hand side, I have NPAS and Remote Access. In that case, I don&#39;t need to configure Routing and Remote Access as a RADIUS client because it&#39;s on the same server.</p><p>When you install the Network Policy and Access server role, it actually changes what you see in Routing and Remote Access.

Two common AAA server solutions include RADIUS and TACACS+.</p><p>Remote access policies identify authorized users and other required connection parameters. In a small implementation, you typically define user accounts and remote access policies on the remote access server.
