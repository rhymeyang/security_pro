The days when you only had to worry about static workstations that sit in a cubicle are gone. Instead, security professionals also have to worry about countless mobile devices that can be brought in and out of office and are subject to a host of security vulnerabilities.</p><p>In this lesson, we&#39;re going to take a look at some considerations you need to keep in mind when it comes to mobile devices and the threats they pose to a network.</p><h3 id="connection-methods-00-30-01-41" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#connection-methods-00-30-01-41"><span>Connection Methods 00:30-01:41</span></a></h3><p>Let&#39;s first take a look at the various connection methods used by mobile devices. Mobile devices use a variety of ways to connect to the internet, the network, and even other devices.</p><p>You&#39;re probably familiar with cellular and Wi-Fi connections. This is something practically all mobile devices are equipped with. However, mobile devices can also use Bluetooth, NFC, ANT, and infrared to communicate wirelessly. And each of these connection methods have their own set of security concerns you should be aware of.</p><p>For example, Bluetooth is susceptible to Bluejacking and Bluesnarfing, and NFC is susceptible to relay attacks, data corruption, and eavesdropping. So, when implementing mobile devices, be sure to account for the various vulnerabilities each of these connection methods have.</p><p>One way to protect against these is to simply disable these connection methods when they aren&#39;t being used. This is probably the best way to protect against attacks that leverage vulnerabilities in these systems.</p><p>Another way to secure mobile device communications is to employ proper security settings and ensure the use of security protocols. For example, make sure to only allow connections with trusted devices.</p><h3 id="location-location-location-01-41-03-14" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#location-location-location-01-41-03-14"><span>Location, Location, Location 01:41-03:14</span></a></h3><p>Another thing to consider with mobile devices is that of geolocation settings.</p><p>Most mobile devices are equipped with GPS, allowing them to use geolocation services. This helps with certain apps, such as maps and weather applications. However, you can also use the GPS unit in mobile devices for security purposes.</p><p>For example, using a technique called geofencing, you can lock mobile devices to a particular geographical area. You specify a geographic area where the mobile device is allowed to function—&quot;a virtual boundary of sorts. If the mobile device moves outside of that area, it can either instruct the user to move back into that area, or even lock the user out from accessing the device altogether.</p><p>This functionality can be useful if you issue mobile devices to employees, but don&#39;t want them to be able to take them home to use.</p><p>Geofencing can also be used to trigger alerts or notifications. For example, it can be used to remind a user to carry out a particular task when they reach a geographic location.</p><p>Geolocation services can be of great value to mobile devices, but they also create some security concerns. One of these concerns is that of geolocation data embedded in images.</p><p>See, when someone takes a photo on their phone or mobile device, the geographic location where that photo was taken is embedded in the image&#39;s EXIF data. If the user was to upload this photo to the internet, a malicious individual could use the EXIF data to carry out a social engineering attack.</p><p>To combat this, be sure to disable geotagging on mobile devices.</p><h3 id="compromised-devices-03-14-04-34" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#compromised-devices-03-14-04-34"><span>Compromised Devices 03:14-04:34</span></a></h3><p>Another concern with mobile devices is the fact that they are mobile. Because users are able to take them home, to the coffee shop, to wherever, they have the added risk of being lost or stolen. And if that device contains sensitive information or company documents, you risk compromising that information.</p><p>To protect against this threat, you can do a couple of things. First, you can employ full device encryption on all mobile devices and require them to have some type of screen lock and authentication method, whether it&#39;s a pin, password, biometric, whatever. Just make sure the device requires authentication for access.</p><p>Another thing you can do is require all mobile devices to have some type of remote wipe feature. Most mobile devices have built-in remote wipe features, but you might also have to install a third-party remote wipe feature if necessary.</p><p>And lastly, mobile devices pose a risk for organizations in the form of data exfiltration.</p><p>For example, a disgruntled employee could use their phone to take photos of sensitive information or transfer documents to their phone via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or USB. They could even use the device to record sensitive conversations.</p><p>If this is a concern for your organization, consider having an extremely strict mobile device policy or only allow the use of company-owned mobile devices on the premises.</p><h3 id="summary-04-34-04-55" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#summary-04-34-04-55"><span>Summary 04:34-04:55</span></a></h3><p>Mobile devices pose a unique threat to an organization.

In the case of an Apple or Android phone, the operating system can be jailbroken in order to allow the installation of non-Apple store apps or to gain elevated root privileges.</p><p>In addition, Windows and Android phones are susceptible to app sideloading. With Windows devices, this is when non-Windows store apps are installed on the Windows device. These apps have not been signed by Microsoft and could contain malware. With Android devices, you sideload by installing an application via an APK that was downloaded from the internet.</p><p>Authentication and Credential Management 02:59-04:27 Authentication and credential management are also key issues with mobile devices.</p><p>The average user has to remember usernames and passwords for a variety of network resources and services, including web-based resources. To make life easier, many mobile device operating systems implement some type of credential management system that automatically stores user names and passwords for the user.</p><p>When a user accesses a password-protected network resource or website the first time, credential management stores the credentials for that resource. When the user accesses that same resource again, the credential management software automatically supplies the necessary user name and password. This allows the user to automatically log in to that resource. Windows RT has a credential manager. iOS also has a similar function that uses an encrypted key chain for storing digital identities, usernames, and passwords. Android devices can use the Google ecosystem or a third-party app.</p><p>Using credential management software is really convenient for the user. From a security standpoint, it presents risks. For example, suppose a user has stored credentials to a sensitive network resource or website on their mobile device, and they lose that device. Any individual who finds the device could exploit that information to gain unauthorized access, especially if the user failed to secure the device with a password or pin number.</p><p>Therefore, as a best practice, train your users not to store credentials to sensitive network resources on their mobile devices.</p><h3 id="app-whitelisting-04-27-05-18" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#app-whitelisting-04-27-05-18"><span>App Whitelisting 04:27-05:18</span></a></h3><p>App whitelisting is another mobile device application security consideration.

Geolocation embeds GPS coordinates within mobile device files, such as an image or video file, created with the device&#39;s camera.</p><p>If geolocation is enabled, the device&#39;s GPS location at the time the file is created is embedded within the device files. This includes all pictures taken, such as those on your vacation, with co-workers at lunch, or in your cubicle.</p><p>This feature can be useful in some circumstances, but it can also create security concerns. If these pictures or videos are posted on the internet, an attacker can obtain information about you that you don&#39;t want them to have.</p><p>For example, let&#39;s say a user in your organization regularly posts images with geolocation embedded to a social media site like Facebook. A cybercriminal could analyze these images and quickly discover information, such as where the user works, who they work for, and where the user&#39;s cubicle is located. A cybercriminal could even derive the user&#39;s work hours, work projects, and personal work habits, such as the restaurant they go to for lunch.</p><p>All of this information can be compiled and used for social engineering attacks against the organization.

This option doesn&#39;t require any additional infrastructure to be implemented. However, it can be a time-consuming task for the administrator (especially in a large organization with many mobile devices) and is not recommended. </li><li> For devices running Apple&#39;s iOS operating system, security settings can be distributed in a configuration profile for users to install. The profile can be defined so that only an administrator can delete the profile, or you can lock the profile to the device so that it cannot be removed without completely erasing the device. This option also doesn&#39;t require any additional infrastructure for implementation. However, it does rely on the end user to actually implement the profile, which can be problematic. Additionally, it is not a dynamic strategy, so making even the smallest change to your mobile device security policies would require a great deal of effort to implement. </li><li> A mobile device management solution that pushes security policies directly to each device over a network connection can be implemented.

This is thanks to Microsoft&#39;s Intune. In this demonstration, we&#39;ll take some steps to secure our environment with Intune. We&#39;re going to take a look at Intune security policies, specifically some nice baselines that we&#39;re provided with that can really assist us in this manner.</p><h3 id="security-baselines-00-23-00-44" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#security-baselines-00-23-00-44"><span>Security Baselines 00:23-00:44</span></a></h3><p>So, what we do is search All Services here and do a search on baselines. This brings us to security baselines. There are these great Microsoft security baselines that we can call on to enact good, secure practices inside of our enterprise. These baselines include some basic security settings that we want to consider.</p><h3 id="microsoft-edge-example-00-44-02-34" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#microsoft-edge-example-00-44-02-34"><span>Microsoft Edge Example 00:44-02:34</span></a></h3><p>For example, there&#39;s a Microsoft Edge baseline here. We can go ahead and incorporate this into the security posture of our environment. Thanks to Profiles, we can link it in. So let&#39;s go ahead and take a look at that. Under Profiles, notice there are no profiles set up for this baseline. But we can easily change that. We&#39;ll go in and say this is my Edge profile. We could give it a description if we wanted to. It&#39;s automatically limited to Windows 10 and later. As of October 2019, that&#39;s Edge version 77 and later. So we&#39;ll say Next. Edge has a lot of settings. The defaults are to enable the supported authentication schemes and then list which ones those are. We can set those.</p><p>There&#39;s the Adobe Flash settings, extension controls, and the ability to save passwords in the software built into Edge. We have many security settings. Notice they&#39;re preset a certain way to give a good baseline of security when it comes to the Edge browser. Once we manipulate those, we can then set our scope tags and indicate where we want to assign them. We could go in and set it up for certain groups of users that we&#39;ve defined, or we could always say we want to make sure this gets applied to every user and every device. The last step is to create this profile. So now we have this nice Edge profile based on this good Microsoft Edge security baseline that we have, and we can deploy this out to our systems.</p><p>Notice we&#39;ve done that by assigning it to all of our devices. After the next sync of our clients, as far as their Edge settings go, they&#39;ll be in compliance with the security baseline that we borrowed from Microsoft. That&#39;s the one that Microsoft made available to us.</p><h3 id="summary-02-34-03-02" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#summary-02-34-03-02"><span>Summary 02:34-03:02</span></a></h3><p>And remember, there were other security baselines for you to look at, too. There&#39;s the Windows 10 security baseline, the Defender Advanced Threat Protection baseline, and then of course the Microsoft Edge baseline that we took a look at in this demonstration. Notice that these have versions, too; you&#39;re going to have situations where you get new additions of them from Microsoft, and the version increments at that point.</p><h2 id="_9-6-6-sideload-an-app" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_9-6-6-sideload-an-app"><span>9.6.6 Sideload an App</span></a></h2><h3 id="sideload-an-app-in-windows-10-00-00-00-39" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#sideload-an-app-in-windows-10-00-00-00-39"><span>Sideload an App in Windows 10 00:00-00:39</span></a></h3><p>In this demonstration, we&#39;ll walk through the process of sideloading an app on a Windows 10 workstation system.</p><p>Sideloading is the act of installing apps that we create or own on a Windows system without going through the Microsoft Store. This is a significant change from earlier versions of Windows, such as Windows 8 and Windows 8.1.</p><p>In Windows 8 and 8.1, sideloading an app was discouraged, and was therefore very difficult to implement. On Windows 10 that has all changed. Sideloading is relatively easy now. With that in mind, let&#39;s walk through the process that you need to follow in order to sideload an app.</p><h3 id="configure-windows-to-allow-sideloading-in-windows-settings-00-39-01-34" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#configure-windows-to-allow-sideloading-in-windows-settings-00-39-01-34"><span>Configure Windows to Allow Sideloading in Windows Settings 00:39-01:34</span></a></h3><p>The first thing we must do is configure Windows to allow sideloading because sideloading is typically not allowed by default. To do this, you right-click Start and select Settings app. Then go to Update and Security &gt; For Developers. Here you have three options.</p><p>First, there is Microsoft Store apps, then Sideload apps, and finally Developer mode. This is already set to allow Sideloading apps, so we don&#39;t have to change anything. On some versions of Windows, the top option, Microsoft Store, is set as the default. When you change to Sideload apps, you get a message warning of the danger of installing an app by sideloading rather than going through the Microsoft Store.</p><p>You can also go into Developer mode. It is similar to the sideloading option, but it also includes advanced development features, which we&#39;re not going to work with today. We&#39;re just going to use the Sideload apps option. Close this window.</p><h3 id="configure-windows-to-allow-sideloading-in-group-policy-01-34-03-16" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#configure-windows-to-allow-sideloading-in-group-policy-01-34-03-16"><span>Configure Windows to Allow Sideloading in Group Policy 01:34-03:16</span></a></h3><p>There is another way you can enable sideloading an app and that is through the Group Policy Editor. The great thing about Group Policy is that if you do this on the domain, all systems on the domain that are assigned this Group Policy will be able to sideload an app.</p><p>Deciding if you want to do that or not depends on the number of systems involved. To show you how to do that, we&#39;ll go into the Local Group Policy and configure this. Remember, you typically would do this on the server, but the settings are the same.</p><p>Go down to Search, type ‘gpedit&#39;, and then select Edit Group Policy from the list. The Local Group Policy Editor opens. We&#39;ll adjust the size so we can see things better.</p><p>Under Computer Configuration, expand Administrative Templates, Windows Components and select App Package Deployment. Next, double-click this setting right here, Allow all trusted apps to install.</p><p>When the dialog box opens you will see that by default it&#39;s set to Not Configured. We can enable it here, if we want. We&#39;re not going to enable it because we already did in the Settings App. This is just another way of doing it, especially if your system is part of a domain.</p><p>As always, down here under Help, you can read more about what this setting does if you are not sure. Let&#39;s exit out of these windows now.</p><p>With sideloading enabled, now we can practice sideloading an app. First, you must have an app to sideload. We&#39;ve already done that on this system. You could create your own app, but who has time for that?</p><p>For this demo, we downloaded one and saved it to the hard disk. Key thing here is that we did not use the Microsoft Store. We determined where this app was hosted on the web and downloaded it. Note that this app has an APPX file extension. This file is the app that we&#39;re going to sideload.</p><h3 id="view-the-security-certificate-03-16-04-13" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#view-the-security-certificate-03-16-04-13"><span>View the Security Certificate 03:16-04:13</span></a></h3><p>Before continuing, we want to check the security certificate for this app. We downloaded the app from the internet, so, you want to make sure the digital signature is OK before you install it. Also keep in mind, if this was an app that we created, we&#39;d have to create a certificate and install that certificate.</p><p>Without a certificate, Windows will not allow that app to install. We know this because we tried to do it and guess what? It doesn&#39;t work. There are probably work arounds to make it work but that is beyond the scope of this demo.</p><p>So, let&#39;s check the digital signature of this app. We&#39;ll right-click and go to Properties and click the Digital Signatures tab. Next, we&#39;ll select the certificate in the Signature list box. Click Details. Under Digital Signature Information, it says, &quot;Hey, this signature is OK.&quot; That&#39;s a positive thing and we should not have any problems with our app. Click Cancel to close the dialog box.</p><h3 id="sideload-the-app-04-13-06-22" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#sideload-the-app-04-13-06-22"><span>Sideload the App 04:13-06:22</span></a></h3><p>So, now we have enabled sideloading on the system. We&#39;ve checked the certificate that was used to sign the app and we&#39;ve verified that the signature on the app file is valid. The next thing we must do is to sideload the app.</p><p>Starting with the Windows 10 Anniversary Edition, you can double click the APPX file and install the app. When we do that, the app installer launches. Here, you can see the name of the app, publisher info, version, and some other info.</p><p>If we click Install, the app installs. Let&#39;s do things the hard way. We&#39;ll install this app using a PowerShell cmdlet. The first thing we must do is run PowerShell. Close the installer here.</p><p>We&#39;ll right-click the Start and then click Windows PowerShell (Admin). We&#39;ll elevate privileges and PowerShell opens.</p><p>To make things easier, we put the app into a folder on the C: drive named Install. Let&#39;s change directories and go to that folder. To do that type ‘cd c:/Install&#39; and press Enter. Let&#39;s do a ‘dir&#39; command to see the contents of the folder. The APPX file is there. This makes things easier as you will see in a minute.</p><p>Now that we&#39;re in the right directory, all we do is type &#39;Add-AppPackage&#39; followed by the name of the package file that we want to install. We type ‘./&#39; and instead of typing out this long filename, we&#39;ll highlight it, select Edit, right-click, choose Copy, come down here and right-click. When we do, it gets pasted in. Hit Enter and wait a minute while the app is installed on the system.</p><p>Something happened, but are we sure? Well, let&#39;s see if the app is installed. We&#39;ll close these windows, click Start, and scroll down to find the app we just installed. Click it and it opens.</p><p>If for some reason we don&#39;t want this app any longer, we can uninstall it like we do any Microsoft Store app. You find it in the list, right-click, select Uninstall, select it from the list again, click Uninstall again, and the app is gone.</p><h3 id="summary-06-22-06-45" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#summary-06-22-06-45"><span>Summary 06:22-06:45</span></a></h3><p>That&#39;s it for this demo. In this demonstration we walked through the process for sideloading an app on Windows 10. First, you must have the app that you want to install. Then you must enable sideloading. You verify that the digital signature on the app is valid, and then use the add appx package PowerShell command to install the app file.</p>',44)]))}const
