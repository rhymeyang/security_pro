They only receive unicast, multicast, and broadcast traffic for devices that belong to the same VLAN. In other words, VLANs allow us to take a single physical switch or series of switches and subdivide it into multiple virtual networks. Implementing VLANs provides several benefits, especially increased performance and security.</p><h3 id="vlan-port-types-00-36-00-48" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#vlan-port-types-00-36-00-48"><span>VLAN Port Types 00:36-00:48</span></a></h3><p>So, how do VLANs work? It&#39;s pretty simple. Switches designed to use VLANs configure physical switch ports as either VLAN-specific ports or trunk lines.</p><h3 id="vlan-specific-ports-00-48-01-01" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#vlan-specific-ports-00-48-01-01"><span>VLAN-Specific Ports 00:48-01:01</span></a></h3><p>VLAN-specific ports belong to a specific VLAN, and when data is sent through that port, the switch knows which other ports belong to the same VLAN, and the switch only sends data to those ports.</p><h3 id="trunk-line-ports-01-01-01-21" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#trunk-line-ports-01-01-01-21"><span>Trunk Line Ports 01:01-01:21</span></a></h3><p>A trunk line is configured to carry packets for many different VLANs. However, because data on a trunk line can be from any number of VLANs, the packets need to declare the VLAN destination. To accomplish this, each frame sent over a trunk line adds the VLAN ID, so the receiving device knows how to forward the packets.</p><h3 id="vlan-benefits-01-21-02-08" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#vlan-benefits-01-21-02-08"><span>VLAN Benefits 01:21-02:08</span></a></h3><p>As mentioned earlier, using VLANs provide several key benefits. First, they offer increased performance. For example, many protocols send requests or responses to all devices or nodes that are part of their local area network. These packets are called broadcast traffic, and all network devices need to digest these packets. Obviously, as broadcasts increase on a network, the overall performance decreases.</p><p>By using VLANs, you can segment the network into smaller broadcast domains, which reduces the number of broadcast messages that network devices receive. In other words, VLANs don&#39;t pass broadcast traffic to nodes that aren&#39;t part of their network. Reducing broadcast traffic has a direct affect on network performance.</p><h3 id="vlan-flexibility-and-security-02-08-03-09" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#vlan-flexibility-and-security-02-08-03-09"><span>VLAN Flexibility and Security 02:08-03:09</span></a></h3><p>Two more key benefits are physical infrastructure flexibility and security. Imagine that you&#39;re a network administrator for a company with several functional departmentsâ€”marketing, sales, accounting, development, et cetera. With VLANs, you can create separate logical networks for each department so only personnel in a certain department can access those resources.</p><p>For instance, most organizations don&#39;t want the sales team to access everyone&#39;s salary information. While you could restrict access to systems at higher levels, implementing VLANs isolates networks and their associated systems, making it harder to launch low-level attacks that could compromise those systems. And since VLANs are configured with software, it&#39;s easy to reassign ports when personnel change locations or new ports are added to the VLAN.</p><p>As you can see, VLANs allow increased flexibility because ports are easily reconfigured as needs change within the organization, and the costs associated with those changes are minimal.</p><h3 id="use-with-scada-and-iot-devices-03-09-04-15" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#use-with-scada-and-iot-devices-03-09-04-15"><span>Use with SCADA and IoT Devices 03:09-04:15</span></a></h3><p>In addition to segmenting networks based on functional areas, VLANs are useful when you&#39;re grouping devices that need to coordinate with each other, but are inherently insecure.</p><p>In many industrial applications, systems are comprised of programmable logic controllers, sensors, or remote terminal units that are controlled by a supervisory system. These end devices often lack proper security controls, making it imperative that network traffic is isolated to only authorized devices.</p><p>For example, you wouldn&#39;t want unauthorized people on the network to access sensitive equipment. VLANs allow a company to easily group these devices and separate their traffic from other enterprise traffic.</p><p>VLANs are often used to isolate devices with weak security controls, as is common with Internet of Things devices. A compromised Internet of Things device is easy to use as a pivot point to gain access to more sensitive systems. However, if they&#39;re restricted to a particular VLAN, then the impact of that compromised device is minimized.</p><h3 id="summary-04-15-04-39" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#summary-04-15-04-39"><span>Summary 04:15-04:39</span></a></h3><p>That&#39;s all for this lesson. In this video, we discussed the function and role of VLANs. We talked about the differences between a VLAN-specific port and a trunk line port. Then we discussed several benefits of using VLANS, including increased performance, Flexibility, and Security.</p><h2 id="_5-12-2-vlan-facts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_5-12-2-vlan-facts"><span>5.12.2 VLAN Facts</span></a></h2><p>This lesson covers the following topics:</p><ul><li>Virtual LAN (VLAN) overview</li><li>VLAN defaults</li><li>VLAN advantages and disadvantages</li><li>VLANs and Voice over IP</li></ul><h3 id="vlan-overview" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#vlan-overview"><span>VLAN Overview</span></a></h3><p>A virtual LAN can be defined as:</p><ul><li>A logical collection of devices that belong together and act as if they are connected to the same wire or physical switch.</li><li>A grouping of devices based on service need, protocol, or other criteria, rather than physical proximity.</li></ul><p>VLANs let you assign devices on different switch ports to different logical (virtual) LANs. Although each switch can be connected to multiple VLANs, each switch port can be assigned to only one VLAN at a time. The following graphic shows a single-switch configured with two VLANs:</p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="Single-switch VLAN"></p><p>In this example:</p><ul><li>FastEthernet ports (fa) 0/1 and 0/2 are members of VLAN 1.</li><li>FastEthernet ports (fa) 0/3 and 0/4 are members of VLAN 2.</li><li>Workstations in VLAN 1 are not able to communicate with workstations in VLAN 2, even though they are connected to the same physical switch.</li><li>There are two broadcast domains, each of which corresponds to one of the VLANs. Defining VLANs creates additional and separate broadcast domains.</li></ul><h3 id="vlan-defaults" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#vlan-defaults"><span>VLAN Defaults</span></a></h3><p>Be aware of the following facts about VLANs:</p><ul><li> Many switches have default VLANs. For example most Cisco switches have the following default VLANs: <ul><li> VLAN 1 is the default VLAN. You can use this VLAN but you cannot delete it. </li><li> VLAN 1002 - VLAN 1005 are reserved for backward compatibility with old VLAN implementations, which are no longer being used. You cannot use or delete these VLANs. </li></ul></li><li> By default, all ports are members of VLAN 1. </li><li> Depending on the VLAN number, a VLAN is either normal or extended. <ul><li> 1 - 1005 is the normal range for VLANs. </li><li> 1006 - 4094 is the extended range for VLANs. </li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="vlan-advantages-and-disadvantages" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#vlan-advantages-and-disadvantages"><span>VLAN Advantages and Disadvantages</span></a></h3><p>VLANs with switches offer the following administrative benefits:</p><ul><li>You can create virtual LANs based on criteria other than physical location, such as workgroup, protocol, or service.</li><li>You can simplify device moves. Devices are moved to new VLANs by modifying the port assignment.</li><li>You can control broadcast traffic and create collision domains based on logical criteria.</li><li>You can control security (isolate traffic within a VLAN).</li><li>You can load-balance network traffic (divide traffic logically, rather than physically).</li></ul><p>Creating VLANs with switches offers the following benefits over using routers to create distinct networks:</p><ul><li>Switches are easier to administer than routers.</li><li>Switches are less expensive than routers.</li><li>Switches offer higher performance because they introduce less latency.</li></ul><p>A disadvantage of using switches to create VLANs is that you might be tied to a specific vendor. How VLANs are created and identified can vary from vendor to vendor. Creating a VLAN using switches might mean you must use only that vendor&#39;s switches throughout the network.</p><blockquote><p>If you want to implement VLANs when using multiple vendors in a switched network, be sure each switch supports the 802.1Q standards.</p></blockquote><p>Despite advances in switch technology, routers are still typically used to:</p><ul><li>Filter WAN traffic.</li><li>Route traffic between separate networks.</li><li>Route packets between VLANs, though Layer 3 switches can also do this.</li></ul><h3 id="vlans-and-voice-over-ip" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#vlans-and-voice-over-ip"><span>VLANs and Voice over IP</span></a></h3><p>VLANs are commonly used with Voice over IP (VoIP) to distinguish voice traffic from data traffic. You can give traffic on the voice VLAN higher priority to ensure timely delivery. When using VLANS for VoIP, consider the following facts:</p><ul><li>To create a voice VLAN, use the <code>switchport voice vlan [number]</code> command.</li><li>By default, IP phone traffic on a voice VLAN is tagged with an 802.1Q priority of 5.</li><li>When an interface is configured with a voice VLAN, the PortFast feature is automatically enabled on the interface.</li><li>A Cisco IP phone automatically uses the VLAN ID of the port it is connected to. Non-Cisco IP phones require the VLAN ID to be manually configured on the IP phone.</li></ul><h2 id="_5-12-3-configuring-vlans" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_5-12-3-configuring-vlans"><span>5.12.3 Configuring VLANs</span></a></h2><h3 id="creating-vlan-s-on-a-cisco-small-business-switch-00-00-00-16" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#creating-vlan-s-on-a-cisco-small-business-switch-00-00-00-16"><span>Creating VLAN&#39;s on a Cisco Small Business Switch 00:00-00:16</span></a></h3><p>In this demonstration, we are going to create a VLAN on our Cisco small business manage switch.

Currently, all of the 28 ports on the manage switch belong to VLAN ID 1. To create a separate VLAN or another VLAN on the switch, we simply click on Add, and we give the VLAN an ID.</p><p>We will call it 2 ,since the default is 1. We can give it a VLAN name if we want, or, if you want to quickly automate the creation of several VLANs, you can click on Range, and you can say VLAN 2 through 10, and it will create a bunch of VLANs for you on the switch.</p><p>But for right now, VLAN 2 will suit our purposes.

With VLAN ID number 1 and VLAN ID number 2, we will now go to the Port to VLAN page. On the Port to VLAN page, you will see that all 28 ports are untagged members of VLAN ID 1.</p><p>If a port is an untagged member of a VLAN, that means the packets destined for that port have no VLAN tags.</p><p>You can also have ports that are tagged members of a VLAN, which means that the packets which are destined to go to those ports have VLAN tags, and these VLAN tags are an extra four bytes that contain a VLAN ID and a VLAN priority, which are used for trunking, quality of service, and other advanced features.</p><p>For our purposes, we will simply stick with the untagged members of the VLAN. If we now switch our view from VLAN 1 to VLAN 2 at the top and click Go, our page will switch to show us what the membership looks like in VLAN number 2.</p><p>You will notice that all 28 ports, in this case, are excluded from VLAN number 2. All of the 28 ports are currently tagged members of VLAN 1, and they are excluded from VLAN 2.</p><p>If we would like to add some of these ports to VLAN 2--for example, let us take port 9, 10, 11, and 12--and we will make them members of VLAN number 2. If we scroll to the bottom, we can click Apply. You will now see that in VLAN number 2, we have untagged members 9, 10, 11, and 12.</p><p>If we switch back to VLAN ID number 1 and click Go, we will see that we have untagged members for everything except 9, 10, 11, and 12, which are now untagged members in VLAN number 2.</p><p>They show excluded in VLAN ID number 1.
