By using SDN, network engineers are given the ability and flexibility to control their networks programmatically in order to accommodate rapidly changing environments.</p><h3 id="sdn-controller-00-35-02-00" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#sdn-controller-00-35-02-00"><span>SDN Controller 00:35-02:00</span></a></h3><p>For example, let&#39;s say you work in a datacenter. In this datacenter, you need a lot of equipment to create a network—&quot;servers, switches, bridges, load balancers, cables, et cetera.</p><p>All of these devices are highly capable of making truly intelligent decisions within their individual capabilities. However, they require individual configurations on each of the devices. And if you need to make a change that affects multiple devices, then you need to manually make that change on each of these devices. In addition, making all of these devices work together perfectly can be a bit of a headache. For example, devices from different vendors might not work properly with each other.</p><p>With SDN, however, the configuration, management, and communication of all these devices is standardized and centralized. Software-defined networking takes all of these devices and combines them in much the same way a computer combines internal hardware components. It does this by using what&#39;s called a software-defined network controller.</p><p>An SDN controller functions a lot like traditional desktop operating system. It is able to inventory hardware components in the network, gather network statistics, make routing decisions based on gathered data, and facilitate communication between devices from different vendors. It can also be used to make wide-spread configuration changes on just one device. In essence, it&#39;s sort of like an operating system for the network.</p><h3 id="communication-02-00-03-12" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#communication-02-00-03-12"><span>Communication 02:00-03:12</span></a></h3><p>For example, take our datacenter here. Let&#39;s say this datacenter suddenly gets an influx of user connections, and it needs to spin up new virtual machines to handle the load. Or perhaps it needs to offload some of these connections to another datacenter.</p><p>In a traditional networking environment, spinning up new VMs, routing connections to these VMs, and propagating these changes throughout the network could take too much time, and users wouldn&#39;t be able to use their resources.</p><p>With SDN, however, this influx of users is identified by the controller. The network administrator can then make configuration changes on the controller to redirect users to the new VMs. And because all these configurations are controlled at a central location—&quot;the controller—&quot;they are propagated out to the network almost instantaneously, allowing the users to have no interruption in their connections. When the influx of user connections returns to normal, the controller can then return the network to the state it was in before.</p><p>One of the primary advantages to using an SDN controller is that it can also act autonomously in situations like this. For example, if this scenario occurs again, the controller can remember the actions that were taken and perform them automatically.</p><h3 id="summary-03-12-03-34" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#summary-03-12-03-34"><span>Summary 03:12-03:34</span></a></h3><p>So, it&#39;s pretty easy to see why software-defined networking is here to stay.</p><p>That&#39;s it for this lesson. In this lesson, we learned the basics of software-defined networking, including how it works and how the controller communicates with network devices and responds to events like an influx of user connections.</p><h2 id="_9-3-2-sdn-infrastructure-and-architecture" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_9-3-2-sdn-infrastructure-and-architecture"><span>9.3.2 SDN Infrastructure and Architecture</span></a></h2><h3 id="sdn-infrastructure-and-architecture-00-00-00-23" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#sdn-infrastructure-and-architecture-00-00-00-23"><span>SDN Infrastructure and Architecture 00:00-00:23</span></a></h3><p>In this lesson, we&#39;re going to take a deeper look at software-defined networking, or SDN. We&#39;ll go over how software-defined networking can enhance your infrastructure to be more responsive, scalable, and secure.</p><p>In a previous lesson, we looked at how the SDN controller can respond to changing network conditions and make changes to data flow.</p><h3 id="sdn-layer-architecture-00-23-01-52" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#sdn-layer-architecture-00-23-01-52"><span>SDN Layer Architecture 00:23-01:52</span></a></h3><p>Let&#39;s take a look at the underlying SDN architecture to see how this is done.</p><p>So, we have our controller right here. Remember, the controller itself is just a software platform that contains other applications—&quot;it&#39;s the network&#39;s operating system.</p><p>The SDN architecture consists of three layers. In the middle, there&#39;s the control layer. This is where the controller resides.</p><p>Above that is the application layer. This is where various applications reside. One of these could be an app that creates a network map of all the devices in your network. Another one could be a load balancer that stops and starts VMs as resource use increases.</p><p>The application layer and these various apps communicate with the control layer through what&#39;s called the northbound interface. These are sometimes called northbound APIs.</p><p>Below the control layer is the physical layer. This is where the physical networking devices reside. Even though it&#39;s called the physical layer, it&#39;s also where the virtual networking devices reside. The physical layer communicates to the control layer through the southbound interface. The individual networking devices use southbound APIs to communicate with the control plane, and vice versa.</p><p>Understand that this control layer, the control plane, removes that control plane from the physical networking devices. In traditional networks, each of these devices would have an integrated control plane located on the device. However, SDN removes this from the devices and creates a single control plane.</p><h3 id="controller-security-01-52-02-21" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#controller-security-01-52-02-21"><span>Controller Security 01:52-02:21</span></a></h3><p>There&#39;s one last thing to be aware of regarding software-defined networks. As with the implementation of any new feature or technology, the transition comes with some inherent challenges.</p><p>For example, a centralized controller introduces a new target for attackers. Imagine a third-party application that uses the northbound API to gain complete knowledge of your entire network. That could be very dangerous. Therefore, it&#39;s important to be aware of proper security techniques and how these interfaces can be compromised.</p><h3 id="summary-02-21-02-38" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#summary-02-21-02-38"><span>Summary 02:21-02:38</span></a></h3><p>That&#39;s it for this lesson.
