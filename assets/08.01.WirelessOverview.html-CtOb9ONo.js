In fact, a lot of networks use it as the primary connection method. Chances are you probably have a wireless network in your home. In fact, setting up a residential wireless network at home is pretty simple. Even setting up the SSID broadcast and encryption protocol on the access point is very straightforward.</p><p>In an enterprise environment, setting up a wireless network isn&#39;t as simple. This is because there are additional considerations that need to be taken into account in an enterprise environment. But before we discuss the impact of wireless devices in an enterprise network, let&#39;s highlight a couple of things with consumer-grade home routers.</p><h3 id="soho-wireless-00-45-01-12" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#soho-wireless-00-45-01-12"><span>SOHO Wireless 00:45-01:12</span></a></h3><p>You probably only have a single wireless access point at home. This device is actually three devices in one: a router, a switch, and a wireless access point.</p><p>The router connects your home local area network to the ISP&#39;s network. The switch allows you to connect several network devices together using an Ethernet cable, most likely unshielded twisted pair. The wireless access point allows for wireless connections to the local area network.</p><h3 id="enterprise-wireless-01-12-02-05" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#enterprise-wireless-01-12-02-05"><span>Enterprise Wireless 01:12-02:05</span></a></h3><p>An enterprise wireless network is different from a home wireless network in at least three different ways. First, instead of having a single all-in-one device, equipment is typically separated into distinct components that perform a single function. For example, a router only performs routing operations, a switch only performs switching operations, and a wireless access point only acts as a bridge between the wireless and wired network.</p><p>Second, enterprises need to support many more devices and cover a much larger area than home networks. Some enterprises need to support thousands of clients and cover entire business complexes; for example, many universities have wireless connectivity on the entire campus.</p><p>And third, devices need to be able to move around the enterprise without any connection troubles. The transition between different access points needs to be seamless.</p><h3 id="access-points-02-05-03-09" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#access-points-02-05-03-09"><span>Access Points 02:05-03:09</span></a></h3><p>In an enterprise network, this is done by using multiple access points, which are scattered throughout the campus to provide adequate coverage. The access points will typically all connect to the same local area network through a switch.</p><p>Now, each of these access points can only support a limited number of clients, so having multiple access points also allows each access point to share the client load. For example, if this switch has the maximum number of connections, new wireless devices that require network access will be connected to this access point, here, instead. This is possible because the range of the access points here overlap, which actually brings up another important point: overlapping signals can cause interference.</p><p>It&#39;s also possible for devices to constantly bounce between connecting to this AP and this AP, and so on. This could be really frustrating. In addition, if any of these configuration settings on either of these APs is different, then this can cause connection issues, and the more APs you add to a network, the more devices you need to manage.</p><h3 id="wireless-lan-controller-wlc-03-09-03-59" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#wireless-lan-controller-wlc-03-09-03-59"><span>Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) 03:09-03:59</span></a></h3><p>As you can see, a wireless network can quickly become a management nightmare. Luckily, enterprise networks use a device called a wireless LAN controller (WLC) that manages all the access points in a network. The typical enterprise wireless controller will be in a networking closet and connected to a switch. The controller can then communicate with and manage each of these APs.</p><p>In addition to managing configuration settings, the controller can also manage client connections and manage AP loads. In essence, a wireless controller allows multiple APs to work together as a single system, instead of each working in isolation.</p><p>It&#39;s important to know that a wireless controller by itself doesn&#39;t actually produce any type of wireless signal--that&#39;s the job of the AP. The controller only manages the APs.</p><h3 id="lwap-03-59-04-27" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#lwap-03-59-04-27"><span>LWAP 03:59-04:27</span></a></h3><p>Another type of wireless device is known as a light-weight access point, or LWAP.</p><p>LWAPs are used in conjunction with a wireless controller. LWAPs contain very little embedded intelligence or technology. They are connected to the wired network via a network cable and are able to communicate directly with the WLC, which handles things like client connections, authentication, propagating configurations, et cetera.</p><h3 id="wireless-technologies-04-27-05-31" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#wireless-technologies-04-27-05-31"><span>Wireless Technologies 04:27-05:31</span></a></h3><p>Let&#39;s next look at the two ways a wireless network can be configured. The first one is ad hoc mode.</p><p>In ad hoc mode, also called peer-to-peer mode or wireless mesh mode, there is no WAP or WLC. Instead, two or more wireless devices connect directly with each other to send and receive information. The more devices that connect, the more individual connections that are made. And you can see where the term wireless mesh comes from when you see all these individual connections.</p><p>The second mode is called infrastructure mode. In infrastructure mode, a workstation communicates with a notebook by sending the signal to the WAP which transfers it to the notebook system. The infrastructure mode is more scalable than ad hoc mode. The infrastructure mode also makes it easy to connect the wireless network to a wired network. It is not easy to do that with an ad hoc implementation.</p><p>Once you establish the wireless connection between the network interface card and the WAP, the wireless network operates similar to traditional wired Ethernet networks.</p><h3 id="summary-05-31-06-00" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#summary-05-31-06-00"><span>Summary 05:31-06:00</span></a></h3><p>Now, it&#39;s important to know that wireless networks use what&#39;s called an unbounded medium to communicate. That is, they send signals in all directions that can be picked up by any device in rangeâ€”&quot;they aren&#39;t bounded by insulated wires like wired networks. Because of this, wireless networks are inherently less secure than a bounded, wired network, so you need to take extra precautions when securing a wireless network.</p><h2 id="_8-1-2-wireless-installation" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_8-1-2-wireless-installation"><span>8.1.2 Wireless Installation</span></a></h2><h3 id="wireless-installation-00-00-00-26" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#wireless-installation-00-00-00-26"><span>Wireless Installation 00:00-00:26</span></a></h3><p>When you set up a wireless network, you can&#39;t just put up a bunch of wireless access points and call it a day. There are different installation considerations you&#39;ll need to look at before installing your devices. The first step is to understand and define the usage needs of your wireless network. Once you know them, it&#39;s time to conduct a site survey. In this lesson, we&#39;re going to discuss the site survey process.</p><h3 id="site-surveys-00-26-01-30" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#site-surveys-00-26-01-30"><span>Site Surveys 00:26-01:30</span></a></h3><p>A site survey ensures that the wireless network will perform as desired. It examines the physical layout and barriers of the location, which lets you determine where to install the access points. Multiple site surveys will be completed during the installation process.</p><p>There are three different types of site surveys performed at different times in the installation process: passive surveys, active surveys, and predictive surveys. If a survey isn&#39;t conducted properly, your network won&#39;t perform, and that will cost a lot more time and money than performing surveys correctly.</p><p>To conduct a survey, you&#39;ll need to use a Wi-Fi analyzer. A dedicated Wi-Fi analyzer tool can provide an in-depth look at the wireless signals in the area being tested. There are also several Wi-Fi analyzers programs you can run from a laptop, tablet, or smartphone.</p><p>Before you perform a survey, you need a diagram or map of your location. It&#39;s important to make sure that the map is properly scaled and labeled so you can get a proper reading. Many analyzer tools allow you to import the map so you can overlay the survey results.</p><h3 id="passive-survey-01-30-02-18" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#passive-survey-01-30-02-18"><span>Passive Survey 01:30-02:18</span></a></h3><p>The initial survey is a passive survey. This survey is performed without the analyzer connecting to any specific wireless access point. It&#39;s just in a listen-only mode. Temporary WAPs are placed, and the surveyor walks around with the analyzer to measure signal strength and interference levels.</p><p>Once the passive survey has been completed, a heat map is generated. A heat map shows Wi-Fi signal strength. They usually show strong signals in green, medium levels in yellow, and weak spots in red.</p><p>You may need to perform multiple passive surveys to determine the best placement for your access points. You also need to make sure that the WAPs are installed in secure locations so people can&#39;t physically access them. Once you&#39;ve figured out where to install the WAPs and installed them, you should conduct an active survey.</p><h3 id="active-survey-02-18-02-46" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#active-survey-02-18-02-46"><span>Active Survey 02:18-02:46</span></a></h3><p>During an active survey, you&#39;ll first connect the Wi-Fi analyzer to the access points to measure the network strength and look for any weak spots. Then you&#39;ll walk through the entire location again to thoroughly test every inch. You can also generate heat maps again to visually represent problem areas.</p><p>You also need to check for channel overlapping. If neighboring access points are set to overlapping channels, you&#39;ll end up dealing with performance issues and network drops as devices move between the different WAPs.</p><h3 id="predictive-survey-02-46-03-06" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#predictive-survey-02-46-03-06"><span>Predictive Survey 02:46-03:06</span></a></h3><p>The last type of site survey is a predictive survey. Predictive surveys use software programs to load the building blueprints and determines where to install the WAPs. This can be done remotely and doesn&#39;t require someone to walk through the location to test everything. A predictive survey isn&#39;t as precise as a passive or active survey, but it can cost less and take less time.</p><h3 id="summary-03-06-03-26" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#summary-03-06-03-26"><span>Summary 03:06-03:26</span></a></h3><p>That&#39;s it for this lesson. In this lesson, we talked about the process of installing a wireless network. Before we can do anything, we need to know the usage needs of the network. Then you can perform passive, active, and predictive site surveys to determine how to install your WAPs.</p><h2 id="_8-1-3-wireless-networking-facts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_8-1-3-wireless-networking-facts"><span>8.1.3 Wireless Networking Facts</span></a></h2><p>Wireless networking is commonplace, both in home and business environments.</p><p>This lesson covers the following topics:</p><ul><li> Wireless network hardware </li><li> Wireless network configuration </li><li> Wireless antenna types </li></ul><h3 id="wireless-network-hardware" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#wireless-network-hardware"><span>Wireless Network Hardware</span></a></h3><p>The following table describes hardware used in wireless networks:</p>',54),e("table",null,[e("thead",null,[e("tr",null,[e("th",{class_:"firstTableHeader",scope:"col",class:"fw-bold"}," Wireless Network Hardware "),e("th",{scope:"col",class:"fw-bold"}," Description ")])]),e("tbody",null,[e("tr",null,[e("td",null," Wireless access point (WAP) "),e("td",null,[t(" A wireless access point broadcasts information and data over radio waves.
