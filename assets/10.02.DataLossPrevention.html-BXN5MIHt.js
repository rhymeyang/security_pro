A data leakage incident happens when sensitive data like credit card numbers, intellectual property, financial information, or proprietary company information is disclosed to an unauthorized person. In this lesson, we&#39;ll look at five approaches to data security, including data loss prevention, or DLP; masking; encryption; tokenization; and rights management.</p><h3 id="data-states-00-31-00-55" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#data-states-00-31-00-55"><span>Data States 00:31-00:55</span></a></h3><p>Data can exist in one of three states, and it&#39;s important to use the right security approach for each state. The first state is while the data is in use on an endpoint system, like a workstation. The second state is while the data is in motion, such as when it&#39;s transmitted over the network or to the cloud. The third state is while the data rests on a storage medium, like a hard disk drive, or in a database.</p><h3 id="dlp-00-55-01-29" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dlp-00-55-01-29"><span>DLP 00:55-01:29</span></a></h3><p>Let&#39;s look at data protection through a DLP system. A DLP system works like a guard at the perimeter of your network, allowing unsensitive data to leave, but restricting sensitive data from being transmitted out of the company. A DLP analyzes the network traffic in accordance with the organization&#39;s security policies.</p><p>For example, an e-commerce retailer could use a network DLP solution to monitor for files containing credit card numbers. If one of those files were being transmitted out of the company, the DLP software would flag it as a potential security problem.</p><h3 id="masking-01-29-01-42" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#masking-01-29-01-42"><span>Masking 01:29-01:42</span></a></h3><p>Next, let&#39;s look at the masking approach. Masking works by replacing sensitive data with realistic fictional data. There are different types of masking. We&#39;ll look at dynamic data masking, and then we&#39;ll look at static data masking.</p><h3 id="dynamic-data-masking-01-42-02-04" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dynamic-data-masking-01-42-02-04"><span>Dynamic Data Masking 01:42-02:04</span></a></h3><p>Let&#39;s start with dynamic. Dynamic masking replaces original information with a mask that mimics the original in form and function, making it useful for data that&#39;s in use or in processing. For example, someone&#39;s name would be replaced with another name, or credit card numbers would be replaced with a random number that contains the same number of characters.</p><h3 id="dynamic-data-masking-02-04-02-19" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dynamic-data-masking-02-04-02-19"><span>Dynamic Data Masking 02:04-02:19</span></a></h3><p>This method can be used to control which users can see the actual data. A bank could have third-party analytics performed on their accounts while masking the account numbers and clients&#39; names. With dynamic data masking, the original data can be retrieved.</p><h3 id="static-data-masking-02-19-02-46" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#static-data-masking-02-19-02-46"><span>Static Data Masking 02:19-02:46</span></a></h3><p>Another type of masking is static data masking. This type is helpful for data at rest in a database and can be specified by field or column. You may want to use this method if you&#39;re making copies of a database for testing, development, or reporting. The complex algorithms in static masking make the original data irretrievable through reverse-engineering, so making a masked copy may be a better choice than masking the original database.</p><h3 id="encryption-02-46-03-07" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#encryption-02-46-03-07"><span>Encryption 02:46-03:07</span></a></h3><p>All right. Next, let&#39;s briefly review encryption. Encryption happens when an algorithm changes plain text data into unreadable ciphertext. The encryption algorithm has a variable that&#39;s called a key. The authorized user that receives the encrypted data can decrypt it through the cipher key. This helps to protect data in motion.</p><h3 id="tokenization-03-07-03-43" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#tokenization-03-07-03-43"><span>Tokenization 03:07-03:43</span></a></h3><p>Now let&#39;s look at a tokenization approach. Tokenization is similar to encryption and masking--it replaces actual data with something else. But tokenization uses a randomly generated alphanumeric character set called a token to replace the original data. The token server stores the original data and is protected by security measures like authentication and authorization protocols so that the original information is disclosed only when the correct token is presented. This method is frequently used for credit card numbers, bank accounts, medical records, and other personally identifiable information.</p><h3 id="tokenization-03-43-04-18" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#tokenization-03-43-04-18"><span>Tokenization 03:43-04:18</span></a></h3><p>For example, when you have a credit card number stored on your mobile phone through an app, the app connects with the remote token server, which creates the token and replaces the credit card number stored in your phone.</p><p>Then, when you go to use your phone&#39;s app to pay for your purchase at the store, the store&#39;s point of sale terminal will contact a merchant acquirer. The merchant acquirer presents the token value to the remote token server. The server uses the token to map back to your actual credit card number and authorize the purchase. An authorization is sent to the merchant, and a message from the server is sent to your phone.</p><h3 id="rights-management-04-18-04-53" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#rights-management-04-18-04-53"><span>Rights Management 04:18-04:53</span></a></h3><p>Finally, we have rights management. Rights management is data protection at the file level. With rights management, you identify sensitive files in the file system and embed them with your organization&#39;s security policy. The key benefit of this approach is that the security policy travels with the specific file even if it&#39;s moved or copied. You can continue to control access to the file, such as restricting who it can be transferred to, even when the file is no longer on your system. Rights management falls into two categories: Digital Rights Management, or DRM, and Information Rights Management, or IRM.</p><h3 id="data-rights-management-04-53-05-38" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#data-rights-management-04-53-05-38"><span>Data Rights Management 04:53-05:38</span></a></h3><p>DRM is file level management applied to rich media like music, videos, and software. This strategy uses security technologies such as encryption, permissions, product keys, limited install applications, and persistent online authentication to prevent editing, sharing, and unauthorized copying. The purpose is to protect copyrighted media and software. For example, when a consumer purchases a software program, the program is not accessible without a product key provided by the manufacturer at the time of purchase. An example of continuous online authentication is when a consumer logs in to an online application or streams the information through an account that requires authentication.</p><h3 id="information-rights-management-05-38-06-10" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#information-rights-management-05-38-06-10"><span>Information Rights Management 05:38-06:10</span></a></h3><p>Now let&#39;s move on to IRM, or Information Rights Management. It&#39;s also called Enterprise Rights Management sometimes. It focuses on business-to-business transfers for files such as documents, emails, spreadsheets, and financial data. Information rights management utilizes encryption and permissions to create rules for the files, which can allow or deny copying and pasting, editing, forwarding, and printing. An example is a contract document that only the recipient can open and digitally sign and is denied forwarding abilities.</p><h3 id="summary-06-10-06-52" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#summary-06-10-06-52"><span>Summary 06:10-06:52</span></a></h3><p>That&#39;s it for this lesson. In this video, we review five approaches to data protection. First, we looked at data loss prevention. Next, we discussed two types of masking, dynamic and static. We talked about encryption, which uses a cipher with a key to encode information that can be decoded with a key by the receiver. Next, we discussed tokenization, which uses an alphanumeric value as a token to replace sensitive information that&#39;s protected by the token server. And finally, we went over rights management, which protects data through permissions at the file level that stay with the file even if it leaves your network.</p><h2 id="_10-2-2-dlp-facts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_10-2-2-dlp-facts"><span>10.2.2 DLP Facts</span></a></h2><p>Every business has sensitive data in its system and keeping it protected is a high priority.
