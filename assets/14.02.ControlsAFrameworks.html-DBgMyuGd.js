As a security professional, your job is to protect the company&#39;s assets and business. This means that you&#39;re there to prevent hazardous events or to minimize their damage. Let&#39;s get started.</p><h3 id="managerial-00-18-00-38" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#managerial-00-18-00-38"><span>Managerial 00:18-00:38</span></a></h3><p>Managerial controls consist of management techniques and administrative procedures. These can include security policies, hiring policies, disaster recovery plans, or DPRs, and business continuity plans, or BCPs. You should always include written plans for how and when to escalate events and when you need to consult outside help.</p><h3 id="operational-00-38-00-50" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#operational-00-38-00-50"><span>Operational 00:38-00:50</span></a></h3><p>Operational controls are ones that the security team performs everyday. These might include reviewing network monitoring data, ensuring that security cameras are working, and requiring visitors to sign in.</p><h3 id="technical-00-50-01-04" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#technical-00-50-01-04"><span>Technical 00:50-01:04</span></a></h3><p>Technical controls are based around software, applications, and security appliances. These controls vary greatly by company. Some examples you might see in your line of work are IDSs, IPSs, access control apps, and ASAs.</p><h3 id="preventative-01-04-01-40" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#preventative-01-04-01-40"><span>Preventative 01:04-01:40</span></a></h3><p>We use preventative controls for security breaches, but you might see these tools used with other control types as well. The easiest preventative control is an Advance Network Appliance, which is sometimes also called an Adaptive Security Appliance, or ASA. This is basically a firewall and router combination that&#39;s capable of hosting IDSs and IPSs. A less expensive preventative control is a simple updated antivirus, considering that these have improved drastically over the years. Office access control is also an excellent preventative control, especially if you&#39;re using biometrics.</p><h3 id="detective-01-40-01-57" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#detective-01-40-01-57"><span>Detective 01:40-01:57</span></a></h3><p>Detective controls inform the security team of an event that&#39;s occurring or provide them with logs and artifacts to them help investigate the event further. Examples would be network monitoring applications, log collectors, real-time monitoring alerts, and intrusion detection systems, or IDSs.</p><h3 id="corrective-01-57-02-23" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#corrective-01-57-02-23"><span>Corrective 01:57-02:23</span></a></h3><p>Corrective controls are those that attempt to fix any damage caused by an event. These tools work during and after the course of the event. Think of this as a form of risk mitigation. For example, an intrusion prevention system, or IPS, is designed to intercept packets that are potentially malicious and either drop or isolate them. Another example is endpoint protection, which works to stop malicious data by looking at its signature or behavior.</p><h3 id="deterrent-02-23-02-50" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#deterrent-02-23-02-50"><span>Deterrent 02:23-02:50</span></a></h3><p>The deterrent control type discourages malicious actors from trying to breach a network. The more deterrents you have, the less likely it is that anyone will try. These could include internal security policies, access-protected doors for a server room, entry-point access restriction, biometric sensors, man traps, security cameras, security training, and security guards. Remember, the stronger the deterrents, the less likely it is that a breach occurs.</p><h3 id="compensating-02-50-03-13" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#compensating-02-50-03-13"><span>Compensating 02:50-03:13</span></a></h3><p>A compensating control is one that doesn&#39;t stop an event, but instead helps by making up for the damage done. The perfect example is data backups. If a company gets hit with malware that deletes data, locks files, or makes data inaccessible, the IT team can revert to the latest backup. Depending on the extent of the damage, good backups can have critical servers back online within minutes.</p><h3 id="physical-03-13-03-42" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#physical-03-13-03-42"><span>Physical 03:13-03:42</span></a></h3><p>Physical deterrents keep unauthorized people from physically accessing a company&#39;s assets. So locked doors, proximity cards, fences, cameras, and guards are all ways to physically protect your network. Motion detectors for after-hours monitoring is another example.</p><p>Please note that device management is often overlooked by companies. With the prevalence of mobile devices, your company should be able to remotely wipe any devices that are lost or stolen. Let&#39;s look at some scenarios.</p><h3 id="physical-scenarios-03-42-04-19" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#physical-scenarios-03-42-04-19"><span>Physical Scenarios 03:42-04:19</span></a></h3><p>Let&#39;s say that a biometric thumbprint scanner has been installed in the lobby of your building. It requires everyone to scan their thumb to gain access. A malicious actor tries to enter, but their print doesn&#39;t match. An access-denied alert is flashed on the screen, and the IT team is fully aware of what&#39;s happening. Usually, the imposter doesn&#39;t stay around to be questioned!</p><p>Another common ploy is for an imposter to try and take advantage of a person&#39;s kindness. In this case, an imposter tries to gain entrance from a legitimate employee&#39;s proximity badge by claiming to have forgotten theirs. Hopefully, the employee remembers their security training and politely tells the imposter, &quot;No.&quot;</p><h3 id="summary-04-19-04-44" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#summary-04-19-04-44"><span>Summary 04:19-04:44</span></a></h3><p>That&#39;s it for this lesson. In this lesson, we learned about control categories as well as control types. Categories include managerial, operational, and technical. The security control types we learned about are preventative, corrective, deterrent, compensating, and physical. You should use all of these tools together to help you create a secure network.</p><h2 id="_14-2-2-control-categories-and-types-facts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_14-2-2-control-categories-and-types-facts"><span>14.2.2 Control Categories and Types Facts</span></a></h2><p>This lesson covers the following topics:</p><ul><li>Control categories</li><li>Control types</li></ul><h3 id="control-categories" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#control-categories"><span>Control Categories</span></a></h3><p>Control categories define techniques used to protect network data and security.

The General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, changed the way in which EU companies handled personal data. This regulation brought concepts like the right to be forgotten and the ability for individuals to demand accountability from companies for their personally identifiable information, or PII. This meant transparency in terms of how their PII is used and who the company can sell it to. The regulation was broad and applied to any companies doing business in the EU and any companies that had the personal data of an EU citizen.</p><p>GDPR also required companies to update their privacy policies as well as their cookie-use policies. These terms had to be written in layman&#39;s terms for the user&#39;s benefit. No more legalese. It also required these policies to be easy to find. That&#39;s why you see pop-up windows about cookies and privacy when you go to many websites. Implementing the necessary changes cost many millions of dollars and non-compliance carries steep monetary penalties.</p><h3 id="national-and-state-laws-01-20-01-56" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#national-and-state-laws-01-20-01-56"><span>National and State Laws 01:20-01:56</span></a></h3><p>GDPR was not the first law regarding privacy and network security. Countries like Russia, Japan, and Australia also have data privacy laws. In June of 2020, California implemented the California Consumer Privacy Act. Much like GDPR, the CCPA requires greater transparency from companies about any Californian&#39;s data. This trend of privacy laws is gathering momentum, and there are dozens of states working on their own versions.</p><p>Let&#39;s not forget about HIPAA in the U.S. HIPAA has been around since 1996, with additions in 2013.

NIST&#39;s publications are used by the federal government and all its departments, including the Department of Defense. NIST&#39;s cybersecurity frameworks are the gold standard in our business, and they have numerous targeted frameworks within the cybersecurity realm.</p><p>NIST has frameworks for cybersecurity, risk management, and privacy. Each of these areas fall under the security vertical and are critical to a solid cyber defense and contingency plan. The NIST security framework families are used to evaluate the security posture of government agencies as well as government vendors. Many private companies also use NIST as their standard for vendors since the standard is so robust. Whether a company needs guidance in security controls, compliance, cloud security, cryptography, access controls, or a myriad of other security-related topics, NIST has a publication for it. NIST 800-53 Rev. 5, for example, is the security and privacy controls standard for information systems and organizations.
