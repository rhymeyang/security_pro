Your organization&#39;s network security policies should contain specifications and procedures for first responders. The policies and procedures should explicitly list a first responder&#39;s responsibilities.</p><p>The incident response process should include the following elements: preparation and training, containment and eradication, recovery operations and documentation, and an after-incident review. Let&#39;s look at some general guidelines you can implement to accomplish these goals.</p><h3 id="preparation-and-identification-00-44-01-47" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#preparation-and-identification-00-44-01-47"><span>Preparation and Identification 00:44-01:47</span></a></h3><p>First, an incident response plan needs to be created. Once it&#39;s created, frontline employees need to be trained.</p><p>Make sure users know the difference between a security incident and a security event. A security event is an outlier and does not require any action. A security incident, on the other hand, requires specialized action by first responders.</p><p>This helps prevent the users from trying to intervene because they may make the situation worse or destroy evidence. Train users not to touch anything if they think a security incident has happened or is happening. The user should immediately contact a first responder, and the first responder will take over.</p><p>The role of the first responder depends on the organization. A large organization may have a dedicated response team with trained first responders. Smaller organizations probably have individuals within the IT Department who are trained in first responder skills, techniques, and procedures. In either case, those are the individuals to contact if a security event occurs.</p><h3 id="containment-and-eradication-01-47-02-52" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#containment-and-eradication-01-47-02-52"><span>Containment and Eradication 01:47-02:52</span></a></h3><p>When on site, the first thing the first responder needs to do is isolate the threat to prevent further damage and exposure. If needed, secure the scene. The goal is to contain the damage. Initially, the first responder should identify the scope of the security event and determine whether that event is still in progress. If it is in progress, then the first responder should do whatever it takes to shut down the attack, which may be as simple as pulling out a network cable.</p><p>The next step in securing the scene is to preserve all evidence. In addition, while securing the scene, the first responder must escalate the issue to the right people within the organization. The organization&#39;s leadership needs to be informed because they are held liable for what has happened, and they need to have the correct information. It&#39;s critical that the right people are informed of the security event and brought on site.</p><p>The first responder won&#39;t necessarily fix the issue. This persons performs a technical triage much like paramedics do at the scene of an accident. A different team may come in to perform deeper analysis and collect evidence.</p><h3 id="recovery-02-52-03-12" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#recovery-02-52-03-12"><span>Recovery 02:52-03:12</span></a></h3><p>After the incident is resolved, it&#39;s time to start the recovery process. This includes restoring data, turning servers back on, and repairing broken systems or applications. This is also when the damage and repair needs are assessed. This step is performed by the network admins since they know the backup systems and the needs of the company.</p><h3 id="documentation-and-review-03-12-03-52" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#documentation-and-review-03-12-03-52"><span>Documentation and Review 03:12-03:52</span></a></h3><p>In addition, the first responder should document exactly what happened. The first responder should note the time the call is received, what was observed at the site, and what the user who reported the incident said and observed. In this step, screenshots are worth their weight in gold. It&#39;s also a good idea to have a second pair of eyes while this documentation is occurring, since these situations tend to be chaotic. All documentation then needs to be gathered and stored together. I also recommend having a &quot;What have we learned?&quot; session after the incident. This will cover topics like what your team did right, what you could have done better, and whether the incident response procedures were good or need improvement.</p><h3 id="tools-for-first-responders-03-52-04-19" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#tools-for-first-responders-03-52-04-19"><span>Tools For First Responders 03:52-04:19</span></a></h3><p>The tools that first responders need are normally in use by the IT department. Network monitoring applications are vital for establishing a network&#39;s normal state, or baseline. This baseline is where most security incidents are identified. A screenshot tool is very useful since some evidence is better used as a picture. And a tested data backup system is essential in order to restore servers without losing days or weeks of work.</p><h3 id="summary-04-19-04-58" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#summary-04-19-04-58"><span>Summary 04:19-04:58</span></a></h3><p>That&#39;s it for this lesson.

Then we talked about general guidelines to help first responder achieve those goals, such as notifying the right people, securing the scene, and training users to identify a security event occurs. We talked about recovering data and systems that were affected. We also discussed the need to document all actions taken and review the entire process once it is over.

The way this model is used depends on the security analyst. Normally, the analysts and first responders use these points (called meta or core features) to find and predict different attacks. For example, If you can identify the types of victims and why they were attacked, then the analyst/first responder can make an educated guess about who is behind the attacks and potential future victims.

The Acme Company has logged two separate security incidents. By using the Diamond Model, the incidence response team identified similar infrastructure and capabilities. These translate into the delivery method and command and control categories in the Kill Chain. Each incident is then compared to other recorded incidents at the Acme Company. When horizontal similarities are found, a threat group is created. Then the known information is entered into the opensource MITRE ATT@CK database.
