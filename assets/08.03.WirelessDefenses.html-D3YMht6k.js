All access points are shipped with a default login, such as admin. No other setting matters more than this one because if an attacker has our login information, they basically have complete control of the whole device.</p><h3 id="ssid-00-55-01-49" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ssid-00-55-01-49"><span>SSID 00:55-01:49</span></a></h3><p>The next setting we should change is the network name, or SSID, which stands for service set identifier. The SSID can be a maximum of 32 bytes in length. We want to make sure that our SSID is unique to ourselves, but it shouldn&#39;t include identifiable information such as last name or address.</p><p>By default, the SSID is broadcast, and anyone within range can see the network name. We can, though, disable this right from the start if we choose. This might seem like an obvious setting to enable, but it doesn&#39;t actually provide as much security as you&#39;d think. A determined hacker can easily discover hidden SSIDs, and beyond that, disabling the SSID can cause connection issues for your device. You should experiment to see if disabling your SSID is the best option for your network.</p><h3 id="mac-address-filtering-01-49-02-31" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#mac-address-filtering-01-49-02-31"><span>MAC Address Filtering 01:49-02:31</span></a></h3><p>You can also configure your wireless access point to use MAC address filtering. This makes it so only hosts that have certain MAC addresses can connect, which helps you control which systems are allowed access in the first place. MAC address filtering provides a minimal level of security at best, though. It may discourage a casual attacker, but it won&#39;t stop a determined one.</p><p>If an attacker is really set on gaining access to your wireless network, they can sniff packets and see which MAC addresses are being used to connect to the wireless access point. Then they can use MAC address spoofing to configure their system with one of the allowed MAC addresses.</p><h3 id="wi-fi-signal-strength-02-31-03-22" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#wi-fi-signal-strength-02-31-03-22"><span>Wi-Fi Signal Strength 02:31-03:22</span></a></h3><p>You should also monitor your wireless access point antenna placement and wireless access point antenna power levels.</p><p>Data emanation is a significant security problem. By default, the radio signals used by a wireless network broadcast omni-directionally. That radio signal travels farther than you realize, which makes it possible for an attacker outside of your building to access your wireless network. You can limit this exposure by manipulating your wireless access point antenna placement and your wireless access point power levels to reduce the amount of data emanation outside of the building.</p><p>Proper access point configuration is important to keeping a wireless network safe. But the most important security step is choosing the correct encryption method. Using a weak encryption method like WEP would make a network vulnerable to any hacker.</p><h3 id="cryptographic-protocols-03-22-03-35" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#cryptographic-protocols-03-22-03-35"><span>Cryptographic Protocols 03:22-03:35</span></a></h3><p>When we configure our wireless network, it&#39;s important that we select the best cryptographic protocols available.

There are two versions availableâ€”WPA2-Personal and WPA2-Enterprise. WPA2-Personal, also known as WPA2-PSK, or WPA2 pre-shared key, protects our network by using a pre-shared key referred to as the passphrase. WPA2-Enterprise verifies users through a RADIUS server.</p><p>WPA2-Personal uses AES with CCMP to encrypt all data. This stands for Advanced Encryption Standard with Counter Mode Cypher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol. AES with CCMP uses a 128-bit key and encrypts data in 128-bit blocks.</p><p>When a device connects to the access point, a four-way handshake occurs to authenticate the device. The pre-shared key and SSID are used to generate a session key during this process. A hacker can take advantage of some vulnerabilities in the four-way handshake to intercept the data and perform offline password attacks that could eventually crack weak passwords.</p><h3 id="wpa3-04-50-05-45" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#wpa3-04-50-05-45"><span>WPA3 04:50-05:45</span></a></h3><p>To address these vulnerabilities and support new technologies, the WPA3 standard is being implemented. WPA3 was introduced in 2018. Instead of using a pre-shared key, WPA3 uses the Simultaneous Authentication of Equals standard, or SAE standard.</p><p>SAE uses a 128-bit key and perfect forward secrecy to authenticate. Perfect forward secrecy is a cryptographic method that generates a new key for every transmission. This makes the handshake much more secure because if a hacker gets ahold of one message, they still aren&#39;t able to crack the keys.</p><p>It&#39;ll take a while for WPA3 to fully replace WPA2 since WPA2 is currently implemented in many network devices.

On a wired network, once a user is authenticated, the port they&#39;re connected to is activated. The port remains off if the user&#39;s activation fails. We can implement the 802.1x Protocol in a wireless network by enabling a virtual port when the user is authenticated.</p><p>There are three components to an 802.1x setup. The first is the supplicant, or wireless client. Then we have the authenticator, which is responsible for handling the communications between the supplicant and the authentication serverâ€”the third component. Know that oftentimes, the authentication server is a RADIUS server. When you use a RADIUS server, the authenticator is also known as the network access server, or NAS.</p><h3 id="radius-03-25-04-50" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#radius-03-25-04-50"><span>RADIUS 03:25-04:50</span></a></h3><p>RADIUS stands for Remote Authentication Dial-In Service. It was developed in 1991 and was originally used to authenticate users to remote networks over dial-up networks. We still use it today to remotely authenticate users. Obviously, though, we don&#39;t do this over dial-up connections anymore, which are more or less antiquated. RADIUS is known as a triple-A protocol, meaning that it provides authentication, authorization, and accounting management.</p><p>When using 802.1x with RADIUS, the client sends their credentials to the authenticator, or NAS. The NAS forwards the credentials to the RADIUS server to verify. If you use a Windows server, this is done using Active Directory. Then the server sends back the verification and user rights to the NAS, which forwards them back to the client. Then the client can access network resources. Using 802.1x authentication significantly increases your wireless network security.</p><p>To ensure that the authentication information being sent between these devices is secure, the Extensible Authentication Protocol, or EAP, is used. EAP isn&#39;t actually a specific protocol; it&#39;s merely a framework in which other protocols work. As a security administrator, you need to be familiar with several different EAP protocols. Let&#39;s start by looking at the Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol, or PEAP.</p><h3 id="peap-04-50-05-11" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#peap-04-50-05-11"><span>PEAP 04:50-05:11</span></a></h3><p>PEAP was created collaboratively by Cisco, Microsoft, and RSA Security. This protocol encapsulates the authentication communications within a TLS tunnel and exclusively uses a server-side certificate to authenticate Wi-Fi clients. This simplifies network implementation and administration.</p><h3 id="eap-fast-05-11-05-48" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#eap-fast-05-11-05-48"><span>EAP-FAST 05:11-05:48</span></a></h3><p>Next, we have EAP Flexible Authentication via Secure Tunneling, or EAP-FAST. EAP-FAST was created by Cisco, and it works by making a TLS tunnel that doesn&#39;t require an authentication server certificate. Instead, this protocol uses a Protected Access Credential, or PAC, to authenticate users.</p><p>Then, we have EAP Transport Layer Security, or EAP-TLS. EAP-TLS is the original and probably most secure of the wireless EAP authentication protocols. Because it&#39;s the original, it&#39;s also the most widely supported.</p><h3 id="eap-tls-05-48-06-18" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#eap-tls-05-48-06-18"><span>EAP-TLS 05:48-06:18</span></a></h3><p>The nice thing about EAP-TLS is that it requires client-side certificates in addition to server-side certificates. The certificate fully encrypts the authentication handshake between client and server and is then used in place of a password, making it practically impossible to crack. But because each client</p><p>requires an installed CA-signed PKI certificate, EAP-TLS is much more labor intensive and expensive to implement than other protocols.</p><h3 id="eap-ttls-06-18-06-53" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#eap-ttls-06-18-06-53"><span>EAP-TTLS 06:18-06:53</span></a></h3><p>The final protocol is EAP Tunneled Transport Layer Security, or EAP-TTLS. EAP-TTLS is essentially an updated version of EAP-TLS. The biggest difference is that we only need a certificate on the server. This greatly simplifies the implementation process since we don&#39;t need a certificate on each wireless device. EAP-TTLS has been supported natively since Windows 8. By using the right authentication protocol, you can greatly increase your wireless network&#39;s security and further protect it from attacks.</p><h3 id="summary-06-53-07-36" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#summary-06-53-07-36"><span>Summary 06:53-07:36</span></a></h3><p>That&#39;ll wrap up this lesson. In this lesson, we looked at the different wireless network access methods we can implement, including pre-shared keys, server authentication, and open networks. We also went over how WPS and captive portals work. Then we saw the various authentication methods that can be used for wireless networks. First, we looked at RADIUS and how it utilizes 802.1x authentication. We finished up by looking at the different EAP protocols, which include PEAP, EAP-FAST, EAP-TLS, and EAP-TTLS.</p><h2 id="_8-3-4-wireless-authentication-and-access-methods-facts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_8-3-4-wireless-authentication-and-access-methods-facts"><span>8.3.4 Wireless Authentication and Access Methods Facts</span></a></h2><p>Wireless networks encrypt communications using a security protocol, typically WPA2 or WPA3.

Many enterprise networks use the 802.1x protocol to authenticate users to the wireless network. 802.1x is a standard for local area networks created by The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Standards Association (IEEE-SA). This standard is often labeled IEEE 802.1x.</p><p>Once a user is authenticated to a wired network, the port the user is connected to is activated. If the user activation fails, the port remains off.

The concepts in this demo transfer to other types of wireless access points, such as all-in-one small office/home office devices.</p><p>To start, we need to log in to our controller. I have a web browser open, and I&#39;ve entered the controller&#39;s IP address. I&#39;ll enter the username, â€˜admin&#39;, and password, and we&#39;re logged in.</p><h3 id="default-username-and-password-00-41-01-14" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#default-username-and-password-00-41-01-14"><span>Default Username and Password 00:41-01:14</span></a></h3><p>The first thing we want to do is change the default username and password for this device. This is the first thing you should do with any networking device you&#39;re configuring. It&#39;s very important that you change those defaults.</p><p>We do this on the Administer tab. Notice we can also choose to use an authorization server if we want to, but just change the default username to something else. We&#39;ll enter the old password and then the new password. Click Apply. The Admin session timeout setting is also on this page.</p><h3 id="session-timeout-01-14-02-08" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#session-timeout-01-14-02-08"><span>Session Timeout 01:14-02:08</span></a></h3><p>This setting defines how much time must pass before the user is automatically logged out.</p><p>This is a nice thing to have, as it keeps users from logging in to the device and then walking away from it and leaving it vulnerable. Let&#39;s change this to 10 minutes. Click Apply.</p><p>Now we&#39;re asked to log out and start a new session with the new timeout setting. Click OK, and let&#39;s log in with our new username and password.</p><p>Let&#39;s go to the Configure tab. There are a lot of settings and options on this tab. On the System tab, we can specify the IP address and subnet mask to use on the network.</p><p>It&#39;s good to change this from a typical IP address range, as it adds another layer of security, but we&#39;ll leave it how it is for now. Let&#39;s go to the Access Points page.</p><p>On this page, we can see all the access points connected to the wireless controller.</p><p>Access Point Management and Configuration 02:08-02:55 Right now, we only have one AP, or access point, connected.

For example, we currently have three different WLANs configured on this controller. Let&#39;s edit the DevRuckusAP network.</p><p>Here, we can see the configuration of this network and that it&#39;s defined as a standard network. We can also configure the authentication options. Right now, the authenticate type is open.</p><p>We could configure this to connect to a RADIUS server, specify that it use MAC address authentication, or use a combination of the two. We can also configure the encryption method.</p><p>We&#39;re using WPA2 with the AES algorithm. You can see we have a very weak passphrase configured, which is fine for a demo, but make sure you use a complex passphrase with this encryption.</p><p>Down here, we can also configure the WLAN to use a captive portal. The Wireless Client Isolation option allows us to configure the network to isolate each connected client.</p><p>There are also a lot of advanced options we won&#39;t get into, but remember there&#39;s a lot of customization that can happen with these types of wireless controllers that you just can&#39;t find in smaller, consumer-grade devices. Leave everything as it is and click Cancel.</p><p>Let&#39;s look at the configuration of the Guest network. Notice the type is defined as Guest, which causes our guest access policies and access control settings to be applied.</p><p>We also need to note that we&#39;re using open authentication with no encryption. This is an open, unsecure guest network. That&#39;s why we&#39;re isolating wireless client traffic from each other. It&#39;s good idea to have this option enabled on guest networks. Click Cancel, and let&#39;s go to the Access Control page.</p><h3 id="access-control-configuration-04-47-06-53" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#access-control-configuration-04-47-06-53"><span>Access Control Configuration 04:47-06:53</span></a></h3><p>On this page, we can configure how client access is controlled. For example, under L2-L7 Access Control, we can define MAC address control lists that can be used with a specific WLAN.</p><p>To define MAC address control lists, add all the MAC addresses you want to give network access to and then enable MAC address filtering on the specific WLAN to use that list. We can also do this by IP address.</p><p>Under Device Access Policy, we can permit or deny clients based on their device specifications. For example, we could deny all clients using a particular operating system.</p><p>Application Recognition and Filtering is another useful feature. It lets us block traffic based on port, IP address, protocol, and other characteristics.</p><p>We configure this by looking at our access points&#39; logs and identifying the different types of traffic. We would then take that information and decide if we want to block anything.</p><p>Let&#39;s go back up to the device access policy and define a rule. We&#39;re going to create a rule that blocks traffic from video game consoles. We&#39;ll name the rule and add a description. Click Create New.</p><p>Notice, under OS/Type, that we have an option for gaming. This identifies traffic generated by video game consoles, such as an Xbox or PlayStation console. We want to deny this traffic, so we&#39;ll select Deny from the rule type dropdown. Click Save &gt; OK.</p><p>There&#39;s a number of other features on this controller that you can use. We can add roles and policies that affect users, and we can add users to the device. We can also configure the controller to notify us of specific events via email.</p><p>On the Services page, we can configure self-healing and background scanning, which are both very useful feature, but they&#39;re outside the scope of this video. We can also configure wireless intrusion detection.</p><p>Wireless Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (WIPS) 06:53-07:36 Wireless intrusion detection and prevention system (WIPS) is, actually, a very useful feature. It helps protect against wireless attacks such as denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, rogue access points, evil twin attacks, and rogue DHCP servers.</p><p>For example, we can protect against repeated authentication attacks right here. We can even specify how long a client will be blocked. This helps protect our system from DoS attacks and brute force attacks. We can also configure the controller to automatically flag APs trying to spoof an SSID or MAC address as a malicious device. This is a great tool for protecting against evil twin attacks.</p><h3 id="summary-07-36-07-50" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#summary-07-36-07-50"><span>Summary 07:36-07:50</span></a></h3><p>That&#39;s it for this demonstration.

Under Add Captive Portal Zone, I want to enter in our zone name, â€˜Guest_WiFi&#39;. For Zone description, I&#39;ll put in Guest Wi-Fi. By the way, for the zone name, you can only use letters, digits, and underscores, but you can use any character for the description name. Click the Save &amp; Continue button.</p><h3 id="captive-portal-configuration-01-44-05-39" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#captive-portal-configuration-01-44-05-39"><span>Captive Portal Configuration 01:44-05:39</span></a></h3><p>Now, under Captive Portal Configuration, let&#39;s check the Enable Captive Portal check box. When we do, we get a bunch of options. Under Interfaces, you&#39;ll see my Guest Wi-Fi interface that we looked at in the beginning of the demo. Depending on your network, you could have a VLAN configured for your guest Wi-Fi. My demo environment isn&#39;t set up with VLAN, but that would work really well for this. This is the one we want to pick.</p><p>Under Maximum concurrent connections, we can put in a number of concurrent connections. I&#39;ll put five in here. This is not the number of users, but rather how many connections a single IP can establish to the portal. For Idle timeout, we&#39;ll put in 60 minutes. If a client is inactive for that amount of time, they&#39;ll be disconnected. Hard timeout limits a connection no matter what. We might not want users on our guest network forever, so you can limit the time they spend. Let&#39;s put in 120 minutes. We can also give guest users a traffic quota. We might not want them streaming video for two hours, so we can put something in here to restrict that if we like. I&#39;ll just leave it blank for now.</p><p>I&#39;m going to leave the next several set to the defaults and scroll down a bit until I see Per-user bandwidth restriction. Let&#39;s go ahead and check the box to enable it. This limits users&#39; download and upload speeds. For Default download, I&#39;ll put in 10,000 kilobits per second, which is about 10 megabits per second. For the Default upload, I&#39;ll put in 3,000 kilobits per second, which is about 3 megabits per second.</p><p>We could use a custom captive portal page. Let&#39;s check the box. When I do, you can see that I would need a custom page to upload. I would also need an error page and logout page. I&#39;m just going to use the default page that comes with pfSense for my captive portal page. But if I were setting this up for real use, I&#39;d certainly want a custom page. I&#39;ll uncheck that box.</p><p>I could also upload a custom logo or a custom background for my page. For the Terms and Conditions, I can put in something like, â€˜Don&#39;t be bad on the internet.&#39;</p><p>For Authentication Method, we&#39;re not going to use any authentication. We could use RADIUS if we had that set up, or we could use some other type of authentication. But for this demo, I&#39;ll select None, don&#39;t authenticate users from the dropdown.</p><p>We could Enable HTTPS login, but if I did, I&#39;d have to configure the server to have a certificate, and I haven&#39;t done that, so I&#39;ll leave that unchecked.</p><p>Here, at the bottom, it reminds us to set up DHCP on our captive portal interface. I&#39;ve already done that, so we&#39;re good to go. That is all we&#39;re going to set up here, so click on Save to continue. And here, you can see that our captive portal has been created.</p><p>Now, before we continue, let&#39;s briefly look at a few options that we skipped and aren&#39;t going to configure.</p><p>Under the MAC&#39;s tab, we can get a little more granular with bandwidth control as far as limiting the upload and download. Under Allowed IP Addresses, we can do the exact same thing, but by IP instead of MAC addresses. Allowed Hostnames is the same, but by hostname.</p><p>Here, we have Vouchers. Vouchers are single-use codes used to gain internet access through a captive portal. Vouchers are commonly implemented in places where authentication is required, but where there is also a time limit on internet access.</p><p>And lastly, the File Manager tab is used to upload files that are used inside a captive portal page, such as style sheets and image files.</p><p>Now let&#39;s test out our captive portal over on our Guest Wi-Fi network.</p><p>Test the Captive Portal in a Guest Wi-Fi Network 05:39-06:04 I&#39;ve switched over to our Guest Wi-Fi network. What should happen when we go to surf the web is that we should get redirected to our captive portal page. I&#39;ll open up our web browser, and we&#39;re directed to our pfSense captive portal page. Remember, I didn&#39;t configure authentication, so all I have to do is check the box to agree with the terms and conditions to proceed. I&#39;ll click Login, and after a second, I&#39;m forwarded to my homepage.</p><h3 id="summary-06-04-06-21" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#summary-06-04-06-21"><span>Summary 06:04-06:21</span></a></h3><p>That&#39;s it for this demo. In this demo, we configured a captive portal on pfSence to force users to agree to terms and conditions before being allowed access to the internet.</p>',68)]))}const
