I know we keep returning to this idea, but it really is that important, and you&#39;d be surprised how often doors are left unlocked whether accidentally or for convenience.</p><p>For example, suppose a high-value asset, such as a server, laptop, or desktop computer was kept in an open area, like an unoccupied cubicle or an office. It would be very easy for someone to walk into the workspace, pick up the server, and leave with it.</p><p>Alternatively, an attacker could remove the server&#39;s hard drives, make an image, and then place the drives back in the server without anyone even knowing that data has been compromised.</p><p>Having physical access to some hardware almost eliminates the need to have login credentials. Almost every system—&quot;&quot;workstation, router, switch, access point—&quot;&quot;can be broken into if an attacker has physical access.</p><h3 id="access-cards-01-12-01-45" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#access-cards-01-12-01-45"><span>Access Cards 01:12-01:45</span></a></h3><p>To ensure access to authorized personnel, locked doors can be secured with sensors such as card readers or proximity readers. Access cards can be used to control entrance to a secure facility, a room, or even cabinet. Barcode readers require a barcode to be scanned using infrared technology. Magnetic stripe readers require that a card be swiped. Card readers transmit a low radio frequency (RF). When a card is within a certain distance, the card uses the RF signal to transmit the code to the reader.</p><h3 id="alarms-01-45-01-59" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#alarms-01-45-01-59"><span>Alarms 01:45-01:59</span></a></h3><p>In the event a door is somehow accessed without authorization, you probably want to have an alarm system in place to notify the appropriate individuals.

Shredding is the most common form of destroying documents, but it&#39;s somewhat flawed since the pieces could be reassembled with time.</p><p>More effective methods of destroying documents include burning or pulping the documents.</p><p>As you can see, these methods could get a bit messy and time consuming, so you may want to consider hiring a third-party company that specializes in secure data destruction.</p><h3 id="usb-data-blocker-03-30-04-19" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#usb-data-blocker-03-30-04-19"><span>USB Data Blocker 03:30-04:19</span></a></h3><p>The benefit of mobile devices is that we can take them anywhere, and if the battery starts to die, all you have to do is find a charging port somewhere and plug it in. While this is convenient, it can also be a security risk. Consider that many mobile devices use the same port for charging and data transfer. Now consider how much valuable information you have stored on your devices. Let&#39;s say you plug your phone into a charging station at a hotel, an airport, or anywhere else that&#39;s not your personal home or office. Hackers could use this connection to steal your data or install malware on your device.</p><p>To prevent this from happening, you can use a USB data blocker. This device is plugged in between your charging cable and the charging station. This data blocker ensures that no data can be transferred to or from from the device while it&#39;s charging.</p><h3 id="summary-04-19-04-38" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#summary-04-19-04-38"><span>Summary 04:19-04:38</span></a></h3><p>That&#39;s it for this lesson.</p><p>In this lesson we discussed some basic physical security guidelines.</p><p>These include locking and securing all doors and securing all physical data.</p><p>If you haven&#39;t already done so, you should implement these guidelines right away.</p><h2 id="_3-2-2-hardware-security-facts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-2-2-hardware-security-facts"><span>3.2.2 Hardware Security Facts</span></a></h2><p>This lesson covers the topic of hardware security measures.</p><h3 id="hardware-security-measures" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#hardware-security-measures"><span>Hardware Security Measures</span></a></h3><p>The following table describes several recommended hardware security measures.</p><table><thead><tr><th scope="col" class="fw-bold"> Security Measure </th><th scope="col" class="fw-bold"> Description </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td> Door locks </td><td> The first line of defense in protecting computer systems is to control access to the location where the computers are located. <ul><li> Many businesses use cubicles, which leave computers in plain sight and easily accessible to anyone. Controlling access to the building is critical to prevent unauthorized people from gaining access to computers. </li><li> Place critical or sensitive devices in a locked room. </li></ul><p> For good physical security, implement the following protections. </p><ul><li> Keep doors to the rooms locked as much as possible, especially when the rooms are not in use. </li><li> Use keypads or card readers to control room access. </li><li> Do not leave the door ajar to adjust the temperature inside the room. </li></ul></td></tr><tr><td> Hardware locks </td><td> Hardware locks prevent the theft of computers or components. <ul><li> Keep servers and other devices inside locked cabinets or locked rooms. </li><li> Bolt or chain workstations to desks or other stationary objects to prevent theft. </li><li> Lock cases to prevent opening up devices and removing components, such as memory and hard drives. </li><li> For laptops, use removable cable locks when computers are left unattended in public areas. You can also use motion detectors that sound an alarm when a laptop is moved. </li></ul></td></tr><tr><td> Access cards </td><td> Access cards can be used to secure a facility, room, or cabinet. <ul><li> Barcode readers require a barcode to be scanned using infrared technology. </li><li> Magnetic stripe readers require that a card be swiped. </li><li> Proximity card readers transmit a low radio frequency (RF).

It&#39;s the backbone of communication and data storage. If this infrastructure is compromised, an attacker could have complete access to your organization&#39;s information. Because of this, it&#39;s extremely important to take the proper steps to secure this infrastructure.</p><h3 id="locked-doors-00-25-01-10" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#locked-doors-00-25-01-10"><span>Locked Doors 00:25-01:10</span></a></h3><p>Let&#39;s talk about the networking closet for a second.</p><p>The networking closet is where things like your routers, switches, bridges, hubs, and servers reside. If an attacker gains physical access to any of these components, they can configure them to allow remote or backdoor access.</p><p>One way you can secure this hardware is to – you guessed it – lock the doors! Regardless of the size of your organization, these networking components should always be inside a locked room that only certain people can access.</p><p>Make sure the lock to this room has some sort of access logging. For example, a lot of key card locking mechanisms track the time, date, and individual when the door is opened. This can be helpful when you&#39;re identifying the source of an attack.</p><h3 id="vault-01-10-01-27" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#vault-01-10-01-27"><span>Vault 01:10-01:27</span></a></h3><p>Another way you can secure networking devices is to keep --them in a locked cage, or a vault.

In fact, if you walk inside a Faraday cage while talking on a cell phone, the call is dropped. Faraday cages defend against attackers who collect electronic emissions from devices. This may seem a bit strange, but it&#39;s possible. The technique is called Van Eck phreaking, and it&#39;s a form of eavesdropping.</p><p>Some hackers are even able collect emissions from processors and identify the decryption algorithms being used.</p><p>Using a faraday cage can prevent these techniques as well. In fact, companies that have government contracts are often required to adhere to a special emission security specification called TEMPEST, which requires the use of a Faraday cage.</p><h3 id="isolated-devices-02-20-02-37" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#isolated-devices-02-20-02-37"><span>Isolated Devices 02:20-02:37</span></a></h3><p>Now, if your organization --allows internet access to email servers or web servers, you&#39;re allowing an untrusted network to access your network.

One way to protect these devices is to use an air gap, a security method where a computer, a server, or a small network of computers is physically isolated from the internet and any unsecured networks. This means that only individuals authorized to access that computer or network can, and they have to do it in person – not from the internet, and not even from another internetwork within the organization.</p><h3 id="protective-cable-distribution-03-24-04-26" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#protective-cable-distribution-03-24-04-26"><span>Protective Cable Distribution 03:24-04:26</span></a></h3><p>So, we&#39;ve talked about securing devices, networks, and data, but we can&#39;t forget physical cables! Cables are, after all, the primary communication infrastructure of your organization. If you&#39;ve ever seen a spy or heist movie where the tech genius places a little clamp on an Ethernet wire to eavesdrop on communications, well, that type of threat isn&#39;t fictional. It&#39;s possible. Ethernet cables leak electromagnetic emissions. And with the right tools, they can be collected. There are several ways to protect against this type of attack. One is to use a transmission medium that&#39;s impervious to eavesdropping, such as fiber optic cabling. But this gets very expensive very quickly.</p><p>Another option is to employ a protective distribution system, or PDS. This is a metal cabinet that locks away all the networking cables and prevents any type of emissions. PDSs also keep attackers from physically removing cables or plugging in additional cables. This method is primarily used by utility companies.</p><h3 id="summary-04-26-04-49" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#summary-04-26-04-49"><span>Summary 04:26-04:49</span></a></h3><p>That&#39;s it for this lesson.

Physical security can also protect resources from natural disasters, such as floods, fires, storms, and earthquakes.</p><p>Depending on your particular network design, physical security should be installed to protect core routers, demarcation points, cabling, modems, servers, hosts, backup storage, and so on. Because physical security is such an obvious requirement, it is easy to forget to plan for it. However, it should never be overlooked or considered less important than other security mechanisms.</p><table><thead><tr><th scope="col" class="fw-bold"> Security Measure </th><th scope="col" class="fw-bold"> Description </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td> Locked network closet </td><td> Regardless of the size of your organization, networking components should always be inside of a locked room that only specific individuals have access to.
