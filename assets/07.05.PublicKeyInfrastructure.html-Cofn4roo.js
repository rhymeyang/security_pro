At the heart of a PKI are Certificate Authorities, which are responsible for issuing, validating, and revoking certificates.

The CSR should contain the organization&#39;s public key, domain name, and digital signature. Then the CA verifies this information and issues the certificate.</p><h3 id="common-name-02-13-02-27" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#common-name-02-13-02-27"><span>Common Name 02:13-02:27</span></a></h3><p>When filling out the CSR, the organization provides their Common Name, or CN, which is more commonly referred to as the Fully Qualified Domain Name.

CAs use the X.509 standard to define these attributes.</p><p>Each certificate has an expiration date. Before the certificate expires, the organization must revalidate the information and renew their certificate. If they don&#39;t, it&#39;s no longer valid.</p><p>Aside from expiration, there are other reasons a CA might invalidate or revoke a certificate. For example, if the organization is found to no longer exist, if the private key is compromised, or if the certificate was discovered to be fake, the CA should immediately revoke the certificate.</p><h3 id="certificate-revocation-list-crl-03-54-04-08" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#certificate-revocation-list-crl-03-54-04-08"><span>Certificate Revocation List (CRL) 03:54-04:08</span></a></h3><p>When a CA does revoke a certificate, it&#39;s added to a Certificate Revocation List, or CRL.

In order to manage the CA, we need to launch the CA console by clicking Tools and Certificate Authority.</p><p>We can see here the CA itself and the certificate categories: Revoke Certificates, Issue Certificates, Pending Requests, and Failed Requests.</p><p>By default, the CA is set to automatically approve any new certificate requests. However, we don&#39;t want that to happen.</p><p>Instead, we want to move the certificate request to a pending state, here in Pending Requests, until an administrator comes through and manually reviews the request. Then he or she either approves or denies it.</p><p>To make sure that this is set correctly, we&#39;re going to right-click on the CA, go to Properties, go to Policy Module, go to Properties again, and we can see that it&#39;s already currently set.</p><p>We set the certificate request status to Pending. The administrator must explicitly issue the certificate. That&#39;s exactly what we want. So, we&#39;re going to hit Cancel and then Cancel again.</p><p>Now if you actually did make any of those changes, you would start and stop the service for the certificate authority before they would be pushed through. You have to do that here: Start and Stop.</p><h3 id="request-a-certificate-01-50-03-20" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#request-a-certificate-01-50-03-20"><span>Request a Certificate 01:50-03:20</span></a></h3><p>With that setting checked, we want to request a new certificate now. There are two different ways to do this.</p><p>With the first method, I install the certificate authority and I also install the Certificate Enrollment Page. This allows users to request certificates using a web page running from the Internet Information Server Service on the CA itself.</p><p>Let&#39;s go ahead and open up Internet Explorer. We&#39;re going to point it to the right URL for the local host. There it is. It&#39;s going to be local host /certsrv. You see here the first task on the list is request a certificate.</p><p>Alright, we&#39;re going to come back to this window a little bit later. The second method is using the MMC console. Let&#39;s go ahead and right-click on the window. Go to Run, MMC, and hit Yes.</p><p>First, we&#39;re going to need to add some snap-ins. So, we&#39;re going to go Add or Remove Snap-in. We need the Certificate snap-in. Go to Add, My User Account, Finish, and Okay. The snap-in is here.</p><p>Now we can see all the different types of certificates that we can create for our current user. We&#39;re going to actually create one under Personal.</p><p>Go to Certificates, right-click, click All Tasks, and Request New Certificate. Go through Next, Next, Select User, Enroll, and Finish.</p><h3 id="approve-a-certificate-03-20-05-41" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#approve-a-certificate-03-20-05-41"><span>Approve a Certificate 03:20-05:41</span></a></h3><p>Now let&#39;s go back to our CA console. If we go into Pending Requests, we can see that it was properly sent straight to our Pending Requests. It wasn&#39;t actually issued.</p><p>So, you can see this certificate is the original certificate that was issued when we created our CA. Let&#39;s go back to Pending Requests.</p><p>From this screen, we can view the pending request and see the request ID here.</p><p>This is where we can now request whether we want to approve or deny this certificate. If we right-click it, we have the option to issue or deny. Let&#39;s go ahead and issue this certificate.</p><p>Now the certificate request is gone from Pending. If we go to Issued Certificates, we can now see It&#39;s been officially issued.</p><p>If I wanted to use this certificate, I could open up a web browser and access the enrollment web page on the CA. Then I would click View the status of this certificate request right here.</p><p>Because it&#39;s approved, I can actually download and use the certificate at this point. We can also verify this by going back to the MMC console. If we go to Active Directory User Object and then Certificates, we can see the certificate that was just issued to my user account. This one right here.</p><p>We can see all sorts of information here. For example, who it&#39;s issued to, who it was issued by, and the certificate authority, which is our certificate authority.</p><p>We see the certification expiration date here and its intended purpose. So, that&#39;s a personal certificate. It&#39;s intended for EFS encryptions, securing email, and client authentication. It was created using the user certificate template.</p><p>If we double-click the certificate, we can view the date range when it&#39;s valid and we can go to the Details tab. Here we can view additional details about the certificate. And if we click the Certificate Path tab, we can view the certificate path up to the root CA.</p><p>In this demonstration, we only have one CA and there are no subordinate CAs. So, the certificate path is actually really short. But in many organizations, you&#39;ll have one or more root CAs with subordinate CAs associated with it.</p><p>So, the Certificate Path tab can be used to view the path through the subordinate CAs up to the root CA. Let&#39;s close this and go back to our CA console.</p><h3 id="revoke-a-certificate-05-41-08-14" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#revoke-a-certificate-05-41-08-14"><span>Revoke a Certificate 05:41-08:14</span></a></h3><p>There may be different situations when the certificate shouldn&#39;t be used. For example, this is the case if the private key gets compromised in some way. In these situations, we should no longer use this certificate for encryption.</p><p>We would need to revoke it. To do this, we simply right-click the certificate, go to All Tasks, and to Revoke. You can specify a reason code for why this certificate is being revoked.</p><p>If you look, the last code is Certificate Hold. This is used in situations where you think there might be a problem with the certificate but you&#39;re not 100 percent sure.</p><p>We want to put the certificate on hold without fully revoking it so that we can verify whether or not it&#39;s an issue that would require it to be fully revoked or not. If there is no issue, we can take it off hold and continue using it. If there&#39;s a problem, we can fully revoke it.</p><p>If you were to use one of the other options here to revoke the certificate, such as Key Compromise, you couldn&#39;t unrevoke it. It&#39;s gone. You&#39;ll have to issue a new certificate. Let&#39;s go ahead and put it in Certificate Hold and hit Yes.</p><p>You see it clears out the Issued Certificates, and now it&#39;s on hold. Let&#39;s go to Revoke. You can see right here the revocation reason: Certificate Hold.</p><p>Because we just held it instead of revoking it all the way, we can unrevoke it. To do this, we right-click, go to All Tasks, and Unrevoke Certificate. Alright, it removed it.</p><p>If we go back to Issued Certificates, we can see the certificate is back for use again. Let&#39;s go ahead and do this again. But this time, go to All Tasks and revoke it for a different reason.</p><p>Let&#39;s go ahead and just say Key Compromise. Hit Yes. Alright, now it&#39;s revoked. If we go back to Revoked Certificates and we right-click, go to All Tasks, and try to unrevoke it, we can&#39;t.</p><p>We get this error: unrevoke command failed. Certificates can only be unrevoked if they&#39;re revoked with reason code Certificate Hold.</p><p>So, this certificate no longer can be used. You would have to reissue a new certificate in order for them to use it.</p><p>After you&#39;ve revoked a certificate, you need to let everyone know that the certificate has been revoked and shouldn&#39;t be used anymore. This is done by publishing the latest Certificate Revocation List.</p><p>To do this, we go to our Revoked Certificates folder, we right-click, go to All Tasks, and then click Publish. This will publish the latest list of revoked certificates to the Certificate Revocation List.</p><h3 id="certificate-revocation-list-08-14-09-24" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#certificate-revocation-list-08-14-09-24"><span>Certificate Revocation List 08:14-09:24</span></a></h3><p>There are two different types of Certificate Revocation Lists, or CRLs. You can publish a full CRL, which contains a list of all the revoked certificates. Or we can just publish a delta CRL which only contains the certificates that have been revoked since the last time the full CRL was published.</p><p>For our purposes, we&#39;re going to publish a new CRL because it&#39;s the first time we&#39;ve actually published a CRL from this CA. Let&#39;s go ahead and click Okay.</p><p>If you forget to do this manually, it&#39;s okay because the CA should be configured to automatically publish the CRL at a particular interval. If we right-click, hit Revoke Certificates again, and go to Properties this time, we can see the CRL publishing parameters.</p><p>By default, the full CRL is published once a week and the delta CRLs are published once a day.</p><p>If we click the View CRLs tab, then click CRL, and then click the revocation list, we can see the current CRL and the certificates that were just revoked. Because this CA hasn&#39;t been in use very long, there are not many certificates to be revoked. Let&#39;s go ahead and close it. Click OK and OK.</p><h3 id="authority-information-access-09-24-10-44" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#authority-information-access-09-24-10-44"><span>Authority Information Access 09:24-10:44</span></a></h3><p>Alright, now let&#39;s look at the properties of the CA. Let&#39;s right-click to Root CA and Properties. Alright, we&#39;re going to go to the Extensions tab. The Extensions tab has two acronyms that are very important to understand.</p><p>The first one is Authority Information Access, or AIA. The AIA allows end users to obtain the certificate used by the CA itself. This can be very useful if you have a root CA that is offline for security reasons.</p><p>This is not an uncommon configuration. Some organizations will keep their root CAs offline all the time to make them less susceptible to compromise. But we still need to have a copy of the root CA certificate.</p><p>To make this possible, we use AIA to publish a copy of the root CA certificate to some other location so that users can still access the root CA certificate. This is important because we need that root CA certificate with the CA&#39;s public key in order to verify digital signatures that the CA has implemented.</p><p>If the CA digitally signs something, you must have a copy of its public key to verify that signature. AIA makes that public key available offline. If we didn&#39;t do this and the root CA was offline, we&#39;d have to figure out some other way to get a copy of that key.</p><h3 id="crl-distribution-point-10-44-11-44" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#crl-distribution-point-10-44-11-44"><span>CRL Distribution Point 10:44-11:44</span></a></h3><p>In addition to AIA, we also have CRL and CRL Distribution Point, also known as CDP. This is where users go to get a copy of the latest CRL. The same issue exists here as exists with the root CA&#39;s public key.</p><p>If the root CA is offline, we can&#39;t access the CRL. We can&#39;t let everybody know which certificates have been revoked. What we can do is publish the CRL to some other location that clients can access.</p><p>For example, we can publish it to Active Directory via LDAP. We could access it on a web page, or we could put it in the file system.</p><p>Let&#39;s go ahead and click Cancel. If we go back to our Internet Explorer page, we can see there&#39;s an option to download the CA certificate or view the certificate chain or CRL.</p><p>This option, Download a CA certificate, is AIA. This one is CDP. If we click this option, we could download the latest CRL or the latest delta CRL.</p><h3 id="summary-11-44-12-15" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#summary-11-44-12-15"><span>Summary 11:44-12:15</span></a></h3><p>That&#39;s it for this demonstration.

Organizations go through the process of obtaining a certificate to prove that they&#39;re legitimate and trustworthy. The highest level of these certificates is the Extended Validation certificate.</p><p>Depending on the browser, you might notice a lock icon or green address bar when you visit a website that has an Extended Validation certificate. This is an easy way to identify that the site has been vetted and can be trusted.</p><p>An organization that has obtained one of these certificates has gone through a thorough vetting process by the issuing Certificate Authority, or CA, to prove that they&#39;re legitimate. In this lesson, I&#39;ll go over the different certificate formats and how they can be implemented.</p><h3 id="certificate-formats-00-54-01-18" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#certificate-formats-00-54-01-18"><span>Certificate Formats 00:54-01:18</span></a></h3><p>All Secure Sockets Layer, or SSL, certificates are X.509 certificates. This standard defines how certificates should be formatted. Some of the more common certificate encoding formats used by x.509 include Distinguished Encoding Rules, Privacy-Enhanced Mail, PKCS #7, and PKCS #12.</p><h3 id="distinguished-encoding-rules-01-18-01-51" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#distinguished-encoding-rules-01-18-01-51"><span>Distinguished Encoding Rules 01:18-01:51</span></a></h3><p>Let&#39;s first look at Distinguished Encoding Rules, or DER.</p><p>DER is one of the older formats. It&#39;s a set of rules that defines how data must be encoded in a file, and its parameters are defined by the Abstract Syntax Notation One interface, or ASN.1 interface, description language. DER is a binary, or non-text, encoding format that&#39;s mostly used in Windows systems. These certificates usually have a .der or .cer file extension.</p><h3 id="privacy-enhanced-mail-01-51-02-54" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#privacy-enhanced-mail-01-51-02-54"><span>Privacy-Enhanced Mail 01:51-02:54</span></a></h3><p>Next, we have the Privacy-Enhanced Mail format, or PEM format, which is the most common certificate format. PEM was originally created to securely encode emails, but it was quickly replaced with PGP and S/MIME. People soon realized, though, that the format was perfect for encoding certificates.</p><p>PEM certificates are a Base64 DER file. This means that the binary format is encoded to ASCII text so that you can see the actual characters. They won&#39;t make any sense to you, though, since everything&#39;s still encoded. The encoded data is sandwiched between a header and footer that identify what&#39;s in between them. For example, an encoded certificate would start with the words BEGIN CERTIFICATE and end with the words END CERTIFICATE.</p><p>A single PEM file can contain the intermediate, root certificates, and private key. The majority of CAs offer SSL certificates in PEM format with different file extensions. These could be .pem, .crt, .cer, or .key.</p><h3 id="public-key-cryptography-standards-02-54-04-10" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#public-key-cryptography-standards-02-54-04-10"><span>Public-Key Cryptography Standards 02:54-04:10</span></a></h3><p>Public-Key Cryptography Standards, or PKCS, is a group of standards published by RSA Security.

Two of these standards, #7 and #12, are used to format certificates.</p><p>PKCS #7 is also known as the Cryptographic Message syntax and is based on the PEM standard. Unlike the PEM format, these certificates can only hold the intermediate and root certificates. They&#39;re unable to hold the public key. Also, these certificates are generally used with digital signatures and have a file extension of .p7b or .p7c.</p><p>The PKCS #12 format is also known as the Personal Information Exchange syntax, or PFX syntax. Like the PEM format, these certificates hold the root, the intermediate certificates, and the private key. The biggest difference is that these certificates are password protected.

You can have multiple Intermediate CAs based on their policies and regulations. The Intermediate CAs validate the Issuing Certificate Authorities and the Issuing CA is the one that hands out certificates. When you check the certification path in a web browser, you can usually see this structure.</p><p>For example, when we look at TestOut&#39;s certificate, we see that their server certificate was issued by this Intermediate CA, which was signed by this Root CA. This structure is known as certificate chaining, or the chain of trust.</p><p>Certificate chaining is done to protect the root certificate. If the root certificate is ever compromised, all certificates that have been issued underneath it are now invalid and need to be redone.</p><h3 id="online-vs-offline-ca-01-39-02-20" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#online-vs-offline-ca-01-39-02-20"><span>Online vs. Offline CA 01:39-02:20</span></a></h3><p>Another common method of protecting the Root CA is to keep it offline and only bring it online when it needs to authorize a new Intermediate CA.</p><p>Once the Root CA has been set up and the intermediate certificates issued, the Root CA is generally taken offline. This means that it&#39;s isolated from network access and is usually completely turned off. If an Intermediate CA is compromised, only the certificates they issued need to be reissued. In other words, not every certificate that was issued under the Root CA is compromised.</p><p>The problem with this is that the Root CA can&#39;t manage and update the Certificate Revocation List, or CRL, if it&#39;s offline.</p><h3 id="crl-management-02-20-02-46" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#crl-management-02-20-02-46"><span>CRL Management 02:20-02:46</span></a></h3><p>To remedy this, the Intermediate CAs can be set up to manage the CRL, or a specific Intermediate CA can be configured to handle this job.</p><p>Instead of having browsers constantly checking the CRLs, the Online Certificate Status Protocol, or OCSP, was created to replace CRLs and can be used to determine the validity of certificates. Let&#39;s see how this works.</p><h3 id="ocsp-02-46-03-01" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ocsp-02-46-03-01"><span>OCSP 02:46-03:01</span></a></h3><p>When OCSP servers, also called responders, receive a request from the web browser, they check with the CA and send an up-to-date certificate status. This frees up CAs from having to maintain their own CRLs.</p><h3 id="ocsp-stapling-03-01-03-37" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ocsp-stapling-03-01-03-37"><span>OCSP Stapling 03:01-03:37</span></a></h3><p>To further help with performance, a network might use OCSP stapling. Stapling simply means that the server that holds the certificate also provides any revocation information.</p><p>This works by having the certificate holder send a query to the OCSP responder at set intervals. Then the server staples that timestamped response to its certificate so that in the first SSL or TSL handshake the OCSP validation is already attached. Now, the user&#39;s browser doesn&#39;t need to perform a separate OCSP request.</p><h3 id="certificate-pinning-03-37-04-17" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#certificate-pinning-03-37-04-17"><span>Certificate Pinning 03:37-04:17</span></a></h3><p>Keep in mind that it&#39;s possible for a man-in-the-middle attack to intercept certificates during the handshake. This would allow a hacker to set up a malicious site using a valid certificate. This can be prevented using certificate pinning.</p><p>Certificate pinning is when an application, such as a web browser, has the server&#39;s certificate hard coded in the browser itself. When the application connects to the server, it downloads and checks the certificates. If they don&#39;t match, the application blocks the connection. Just know that certificate pinning was never really adopted by modern browsers, so it would mostly be used inside of an organization that&#39;s running their own CA.</p><h3 id="trust-models-04-17-04-37" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#trust-models-04-17-04-37"><span>Trust Models 04:17-04:37</span></a></h3><p>Let&#39;s shift gears to trust models. All CAs start with a single trust model. This means that there&#39;s one Root CA for the organization that issues and manages certificates. As you&#39;ve already seen, a hierarchical structure is mainly used. It starts with the root certificate and multiple Intermediate CAs below it.</p><h3 id="mesh-model-04-37-04-58" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#mesh-model-04-37-04-58"><span>Mesh Model 04:37-04:58</span></a></h3><p>It&#39;s also possible for you to set up a mesh model. In a mesh model, multiple CAs issue certificates to each other. This works great because if one CA is compromised, those certificates can still be valid because other CAs have authenticated them. The problem with this model is that it becomes extremely difficult to scale up with growth.</p><h3 id="bridge-model-04-58-05-36" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#bridge-model-04-58-05-36"><span>Bridge Model 04:58-05:36</span></a></h3><p>Another thing to consider is how trusts can be set up when one organization who has their own CA structure wants to partner with another organization that has their own CA structure. In this scenario, there needs to be a way for each organization to trust the certificates issued by the other&#39;s CAs. This can be done by setting up a bridge model in which both hierarchies trust each other. In this case, clients in both organizations trust certificates issued by CAs of either organization. You can also be more restrictive by setting up trusts with individual CAs that are lower on the hierarchy.</p><h3 id="web-of-trust-05-36-06-07" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#web-of-trust-05-36-06-07"><span>Web of Trust 05:36-06:07</span></a></h3><p>Another common setup is the web of trust. Instead of using a CA, everyone is a trusted authority.</p><p>For example, if Craig trusts Ethan and Lynette trusts Craig, Lynette will also have an indirect trust with Ethan. In other words, you trust a friend of a friend. We see this setup often in PGP.</p><p>Implementing the proper model can help ensure that certificates are properly maintained and validated. Of course, all of this also relies on keeping our encryption keys safe.</p><h3 id="key-safety-06-07-07-07" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#key-safety-06-07-07-07"><span>Key Safety 06:07-07:07</span></a></h3><p>Keeping a backup of private keys is important, but you&#39;ll need to make sure that they can&#39;t be accessed unless absolutely necessary. Normally, the CA never gets the user&#39;s private keys.</p><p>You can, though, use key archival to back up private keys. All this means is that the user sends their private key in a secure transmission to the CA to keep safe. The problem with this is that a serious security breach can occur if private keys are compromised. The advantage is that the archive of private keys is readily available if any are lost or corrupted.</p><p>Key escrow is like key archival, except that keys are sent to a trusted third party instead of the CA holding the keys. This is often done for security or legal purposes. Getting access to these keys may require legal action, and this is by design. For example, if law enforcement needs to access and analyze emails, they would need a court order to get the keys needed.</p><h3 id="summary-07-07-07-40" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#summary-07-07-07-40"><span>Summary 07:07-07:40</span></a></h3><p>That&#39;s it for this lesson. In this lesson, we discussed how CAs are set up to manage certificates. We first looked at the concept of certificate chaining, which is the method of using a hierarchical certificate structure. Then we covered the difference in online and offline CAs and the best practice of leaving them offline whenever possible. Finally, we discussed different trust models and how to assure key safety through key archival or escrow services.</p><h2 id="_7-5-10-certificate-concepts-facts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_7-5-10-certificate-concepts-facts"><span>7.5.10 Certificate Concepts Facts</span></a></h2><p>Using digital certificates to share public keys and validate organizations is a critical component of doing business over the internet.

By implementing certificate chaining, if a CA is compromised, only the certificates issued by that CA would need to be replace.</p><p>Another common method of protecting the root CA is to bring it online only when it needs to authorize a new intermediate CA.
