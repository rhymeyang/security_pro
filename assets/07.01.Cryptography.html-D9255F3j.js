To do that, you can lock down a system using multiple methods, but there&#39;s always a chance that a hacker will still get through. You can use cryptography to add an additional layer of protection and make it even more difficult for hackers to steal your data, even if they get inside.</p><p>In this video, we&#39;ll discuss what cryptography is, the basic concepts associated with cryptology, and some common cryptology methods.</p><p>Cryptography is defined as the process of writing or solving messages using a secret code.</p><h3 id="cryptography-overview-00-32-01-41" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#cryptography-overview-00-32-01-41"><span>Cryptography Overview 00:32-01:41</span></a></h3><p>Cryptography isn&#39;t new. The earliest known use of cryptography was by the Egyptians in 1900 BC to deliver messages using encryption.</p><p>Encryption is the process of converting normal text into text that makes no sense at all, which is called ciphertext. A cipher is the method, or algorithm, used to encrypt the data. I know that might sound a little confusing, since these terms are often used interchangeably, so let&#39;s look at an example using a puzzle.</p><p>When you&#39;re completing a puzzle, you normally look at the completed picture on the box and then put the pieces together to match the picture. If you wanted to disguise the puzzle from prying eyes, you could use cryptography. In this case, you could encrypt the puzzle by flipping all the pieces over and scrambling them up, so no one can see the images printed on the puzzle pieces. Then, to allow you or anyone else to put the puzzle together, you&#39;ll need a method that&#39;s only given out to certain people. That&#39;s the cipher. We&#39;ll used a numbered cipher here. Using that cipher, anyone would be able to put the puzzle together.</p><h3 id="caesar-cipher-01-41-02-07" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#caesar-cipher-01-41-02-07"><span>Caesar Cipher 01:41-02:07</span></a></h3><p>One of the most common encryption ciphers is the Caesar cipher.</p><p>This cipher was created by Julius Caesar. When he wanted to sent a secret message, Caesar would shift each letter down the alphabet by three places. Then he could safely send the message to his commanders because anyone who intercepted the message couldn&#39;t read it anyway. Since only the commanders knew the cipher was to shift the letters up the alphabet by three, only they could read it.</p><h3 id="cryptography-concepts-02-07-02-19" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#cryptography-concepts-02-07-02-19"><span>Cryptography Concepts 02:07-02:19</span></a></h3><p>Today, encryption is much more advanced than the Caesar cipher. You&#39;ll hear a lot about encryption keys, hashes, and digital signatures. To understand modern encryption, you need to understand these concepts.</p><h3 id="encryption-keys-02-19-03-05" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#encryption-keys-02-19-03-05"><span>Encryption Keys 02:19-03:05</span></a></h3><p>Let&#39;s talk about encryption keys first. We install locks on our doors to keep our homes safe. These locks require a specific key. Encryption works using the same concept. When we want to encrypt data, we use an encryption key. Encryption keys are random strings of bits that are used to lock and unlock data. These keys are generated using ciphers, such as the Advanced Encryption Standard, or AES. They ensure each key is unique and difficult to crack.</p><p>There are two types of encryption methods, symmetric and asymmetric. Symmetric encryption uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt data. Asymmetric encryption uses one key to encrypt and then a different key to decrypt. These are referred to as public and private keys.</p><h3 id="hashing-03-05-03-49" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#hashing-03-05-03-49"><span>Hashing 03:05-03:49</span></a></h3><p>When you&#39;re working with these encryption methods, different techniques are used to help safeguard your data. One technique is known as hashing.</p><p>Hashing is the process of converting one value into another using a mathematical algorithm like MD5 or SHA. Hashes have several characteristics that make them very useful. For example, hashes are deterministic, meaning that the same data being hashed always results in the same hash value. Hashes can also be created very quickly and cannot be decrypted. Likewise, it&#39;s infeasible to find two messages with the same hash value. Even a small change to a message will change the hash value so extensively that the new hash value appears uncorrelated with the old hash value.</p><h3 id="hash-applications-03-49-04-11" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#hash-applications-03-49-04-11"><span>Hash Applications 03:49-04:11</span></a></h3><p>Because of these features, hashes are used in many applications.</p><p>A hash function is often used to verify passwords. Since storing or transmitting passwords in cleartext could result in a massive security breach, most systems only store the hash of the password. When a user needs to be authenticated, the password entered by the user is hashed and compared with the stored hash.</p><h3 id="salting-the-hash-04-11-05-31" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#salting-the-hash-04-11-05-31"><span>Salting the Hash 04:11-05:31</span></a></h3><p>One of the problems with using hashed passwords is that several online sites have collected massive databases containing a hash for tens of million of possible passwords. Once a hash has been captured, it can be compared with the hashes found in the database, quickly resulting in the password used to create the hash. To keep this from happening, most hashes also incorporate something called a salt.</p><p>Salting the hash means adding a random number of characters to the password before the hash is created. For example, if this is the password to be hashed, a salt such as this may be added. This becomes the string to be hashed. Since the salt is randomly generated each time, even if the same password is used and can be varying lengths, it&#39;s virtually impossible to create a database containing all the possible salted passwords.</p><p>Hashes are also used to verify that a document hasn&#39;t been corrupted or tampered with by creating a hash for the document. When the same hash algorithm is calculated at the receiving end, the hashes should match. If not, then the data was either corrupted or tampered with during transmission and should not be trusted. In a similar fashion, hashes are also used to digitally verify a signature, like when you digitally sign an important document using the internet. In this case, only the signature is hashed instead of the entire document.</p><h3 id="cryptology-methods-05-31-06-04" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#cryptology-methods-05-31-06-04"><span>Cryptology Methods 05:31-06:04</span></a></h3><p>While there are many different cryptography methods that can be used to secure data, one of the most powerful methods used today is Elliptic Curve Cryptology, or ECC.

If you&#39;ve ever used invisible ink to write a hidden message, you&#39;ve used steganography.</p><p>One method of steganography is to use a special program to hide a message in another file, such as this image.

A cipher is the method, or algorithm, used to encrypt or convert the data.</p><p>One of the more popular forms of encryption is the Caesar cipher.

But due in part to its short key length of only 56 bits, hackers in the 1990s were able to brute-force the encryption keys. In other words, they were able to try every possible key until they found the right one. In 1998, an attempt to further secure DES was introduced. It was known as the Triple Data Encryption Algorithm, or 3DES. 3DES combined 3 keys to give it a key length of 168 bits, making it much more difficult to brute-force.

The public key is used to encrypt the data and the private key is used to decrypt it. Since these keys mirror each other, the private key only decrypts data that was encrypted with the matching public key. Let&#39;s see this in action.</p><p>Travis is sending his confidential file to Craig. To do that, Travis must first get Craig&#39;s public key. Travis then uses Craig&#39;s public key to encrypt the data, and the file is sent to Craig. When Craig gets the file, he uses his private key to decrypt it. As another example, asymmetric encryption is used in most communication over the internet.</p><p>For example, when you log on to a website, your browser sends a request for the public key which is then sent by the web server. Your login information is entered and encrypted using that public key, which is then sent to the server. The server in turn decrypts the login information using its private key. You&#39;re now logged into the web server. As you can see from these examples, users don&#39;t ever reveal their private keys in this exchange. Data security is increased with asymmetric encryption, which is the primary reason for using it.</p><p>Another reason for using asymmetric encryption is to create digital signatures.</p><p>A digital signature is a method used to ensure that a received message or document hasn&#39;t been modified from the time it was signed.</p><h3 id="digital-signatures-05-23-06-04" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#digital-signatures-05-23-06-04"><span>Digital Signatures 05:23-06:04</span></a></h3><p>This is done by generating a unique hash of the message or document and encrypting it with the sender&#39;s private key. When the recipient receives the message, they can verify the digital signature to ensure that the data or message is legitimate. Since anyone can decrypt these messages or documents with the public key, digital certificates don&#39;t secure data. They simply verify that the data is legitimate and came from the proper source. Guaranteeing the data source in this way provides non-repudiation, or the ability to ensure that the document&#39;s sender cannot deny sending the document.</p><p>There are four main asymmetric encryption algorithms you need to be aware of. These are Diffie-Hellman, RSA, DSA, and ECC.</p><h3 id="diffie-hellman-06-04-07-15" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#diffie-hellman-06-04-07-15"><span>Diffie-Hellman 06:04-07:15</span></a></h3><p>Diffie-Hellman was the first widely used asymmetric algorithm. It was released in 1976 by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman. This algorithm allows two parties who&#39;ve never met to safely create a shared key over a public channel, such as the internet. We can see how this key is created using a choice of colors.</p><p>For example, our two users each agree on a paint color such as yellow. Each user then decides on a secret color to mix with their common color, creating a color they can share publicly. They send each other their results and then mix in their secret color. Each user ends up with the same new secret color. This new secret color, or key, is then used to encrypt and decrypt their messages. If a hacker were to intercept any of these messages without knowing each user&#39;s secret color, they wouldn&#39;t be able to reverse the process and figure out the final secret color. Diffie-Hellman is frequently implemented in security protocols such as TLS, IPSec, SSH, and more.</p><h3 id="rivest-shamir-adleman-rsa-07-15-07-43" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#rivest-shamir-adleman-rsa-07-15-07-43"><span>Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) 07:15-07:43</span></a></h3><p>In 1977, Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman released one of the first public-key cryptosystems, which is known by the initial letters of the developer&#39;s surnames—&quot;RSA.

But they do make it easier to exchange keys. In contrast, Symmetric methods are efficient, but they become inconvenient when the time comes to get the keys out. A hybrid cryptosystem combines the efficiency of symmetric methods and the convenience of asymmetric methods.</p><p>Let&#39;s see how it works.</p><p>Travis needs to send a confidential file to Craig. Before doing so, Travis uses his symmetric private key to encrypt the data. Next, Travis encrypts the secret key using Craig&#39;s public key. The file is then sent to Craig. When Craig gets the message, he first uses his private key to decrypt the symmetric secret key and then uses the symmetric key to decrypt the message.</p><p>As long as Craig&#39;s private key is kept secret, the data is secure.

Perfect forward secrecy and ephemeral keys are used quite often in instant messaging apps.</p><p>Every message that&#39;s sent generates its own encryption key.

They have a sample document here on the screen for us that we can use.</p><p>To encrypt a document, I come up here to the encrypt/decrypt and I select modern algorithms. I&#39;m going to select RC4 algorithm, and in this case we can specify the length of the key that we want to include.</p><h3 id="short-keys-vs-long-keys-00-55-04-17" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#short-keys-vs-long-keys-00-55-04-17"><span>Short Keys vs. Long Keys 00:55-04:17</span></a></h3><p>I want to show you that shorter keys are very easy to crack, longer keys take substantial amount of time if they&#39;re long enough.</p><p>So, here we&#39;re going to select an 8-bit key length and I&#39;m going to specify my key. I&#39;ll just say AD and encrypt the document.</p><p>So, now we have the encrypted document and to decrypt it, if we already knew the key we could just come to this encrypt/decrypt option again, but since we want to discover what the key is, we&#39;ll come over here to analysis and come down to symmetric encryption and select the RC4 algorithm.</p><p>We&#39;ll go ahead and click start and it&#39;s already done. It&#39;s found possible key values and you can see the possible decrypted values up here. And of course this looks like something that we would expect and it says, hey, the key was AD. Go ahead and select that and it goes ahead and decrypts the document for us.</p><p>So, that was very, very quick. It didn&#39;t take any time at all. Let&#39;s go ahead and increase our key length and see what happens. So, we&#39;ll come down to RC4 and try instead a 16-bit key length. And we&#39;ll put in some numbers. And we&#39;ll encrypt.</p><p>And then we&#39;ll come over to analysis and do the same thing. Say 16-bit key length and start our analysis. And again, almost immediately, it comes back.</p><p>Let&#39;s go ahead and cancel out of that and let&#39;s increase our key length over here and see some that start taking a little bit of time.</p><p>Now, of course as processors get faster, you can do these things a lot easier. And in this case, it&#39;ll take just a couple seconds, but as we get to bigger, bigger key, it&#39;ll take substantially longer.</p><p>Comparing an RC4 24-bit, we&#39;re up to 10%. On my system, which is actually kind of beefy, looks like it&#39;s going to take about 30 seconds or so to complete. Let&#39;s go ahead and wait for that.</p><p>Okay, now that it&#39;s done it shows us the possible decryption values and sure enough, the key that it discovered for us does decrypt and shows the original document.</p><p>Let&#39;s go ahead and just show one more. Let&#39;s come up and instead of a 24-bit key, let&#39;s do a 32-bit key and put in some values. These are hex values of course. And then we&#39;ll come over and do our analysis.</p><p>In this case it looks like 32-bit on my machine will take about three hours to complete. Let&#39;s go ahead and just see what if we did a 56-bit key or higher.</p><p>Oops, we&#39;ll come back to the original document and I want to show you how this raises exponentially as you go on. So, let&#39;s do a 56-bit key, which is a reasonable length.</p><p>You wouldn&#39;t use that on the internet today, but in the early days, that was used and it was found to be too weak by brute force analysis, as you might see here.</p><p>So, let&#39;s go 56-bit. We&#39;ll go ahead and start. You can see we&#39;re in to a lot of years in order to brute force with a single computer. Now, of course we could cluster computers or use the cloud to decrypt these.</p><p>So many encryption algorithms are no longer considered secure, because you can do brute force analysis over many different computers. With enough computing power, you&#39;ve got to be careful on the length of your key.</p><p>I hope this shows you that the length of the key matters. You always want a longer key if you want your data more secure.</p><h3 id="summary-04-17-04-49" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#summary-04-17-04-49"><span>Summary 04:17-04:49</span></a></h3><p>So, in this demonstration we explored the relationship between key length and the time it takes for a brute force attack to decrypt a document.

The cornerstone of cryptography is the algorithm, or cipher. Cipher is just a fancy word for the series of steps that are taken for data to be encrypted or decrypted. In this video, we&#39;re going to look at several types of ciphers and how they work.</p><h3 id="stream-cipher-00-23-00-46" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#stream-cipher-00-23-00-46"><span>Stream Cipher 00:23-00:46</span></a></h3><p>One of the first cipher types is the stream cipher. A stream cipher is a symmetric encryption method that encrypts 1 bit of plaintext at a time. This method is based on the one-time pad, or OTP, which was very popular during World War 2. OTP uses a symmetric encryption key that should be as long or even longer than the data being encrypted.</p><h3 id="one-time-pad-00-46-02-06" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#one-time-pad-00-46-02-06"><span>One-Time Pad 00:46-02:06</span></a></h3><p>For example, if you had a small message that was only 15 bits long, a random 15-bit key would need to be generated. That key can then be used to encrypt your message using a process called Exclusive-ORing, or XORing. XORing means that we compare two strings, our message and our random key, to generate an output. We do this by lining them both up. If the bits match, a 0 is generated. If they don&#39;t match, a 1 is generated. The output is our ciphertext!</p><p>What makes this so interesting is that this demonstrates perfect secrecy. This means that, to a hacker, this ciphertext looks completely random. It would be just as difficult to brute-force the key as it would be to brute-force the data itself.</p><p>OTP only works properly if our secret key is only used once. If we use it more than once, a hacker could then start to decode the secret key. OTP works great if we&#39;re dealing with small messages. But what if we needed to encrypt every video in this course?</p><p>A video can range from 500 megabytes to up to 5 gigs or more. Since every video file would need to generate a key that&#39;s the same size or larger than the video, we would quickly end up running out of hard drive space. So with today&#39;s data types, the one-time pad just isn&#39;t very practical.</p><h3 id="stream-ciphers-02-06-02-53" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#stream-ciphers-02-06-02-53"><span>Stream Ciphers 02:06-02:53</span></a></h3><p>Stream ciphers offer a solution to this problem.</p><p>A stream cipher can use a smaller fixed-length key that can be used repeatedly throughout the encryption process. This key is called a seed key, and in our example we&#39;ll say that it&#39;s 2048 bits. This key is run through a pseudorandom number generator which outputs a new and unique encryption key called a keystream. Notice that this new key matches the size of our data. The keystream is then XORed with the data to give us our ciphertext.</p><p>While stream ciphers are less secure than the one-time pad, the advantage to this method is that it can be used in real time. One of the most widely used stream ciphers was RC4. But due to multiple vulnerabilities discovered, it&#39;s no longer in use.</p><h3 id="block-ciphers-02-53-03-45" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#block-ciphers-02-53-03-45"><span>Block Ciphers 02:53-03:45</span></a></h3><p>Many symmetric encryption algorithms use the block cipher method. With block ciphers, instead of encrypting our data one bit at a time, the data is encrypted one chunk or block at a time. The common block sizes used are 64, 128, or 256 bits in length.</p><p>For example, let&#39;s say that we want to encrypt a file that&#39;s 800 bits in size. Using a 256-bit block size, the data will be encrypted 256 bits, or 32 bytes, at a time until the process is complete. Since the last block ends up being smaller than 256 bits, the algorithm pads the block with some random data to bring it up to 256 bits.</p><p>As shown here, there are several block cipher operation modes that can be utilized depending on the application or use. Let&#39;s talk about a few of them.</p><h3 id="electronic-code-book-ecb-03-45-04-12" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#electronic-code-book-ecb-03-45-04-12"><span>Electronic Code Book (ECB) 03:45-04:12</span></a></h3><p>Electronic Code Book Mode, or ECB, is the simplest block cipher operation mode.</p><p>With this mode, each block of plaintext data is encrypted separately. Several blocks can be encrypted at the same time, allowing for faster encryption. The biggest disadvantage is that identical data results in the same ciphertext, meaning that a hacker would be able to decipher some of the data if they intercept multiple blocks.</p><h3 id="cipher-block-chaining-cbc-04-12-04-41" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#cipher-block-chaining-cbc-04-12-04-41"><span>Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) 04:12-04:41</span></a></h3><p>Cipher Block Chaining is like ECB, except that it uses an initialization vector. The initialization vector is a starting variable that&#39;s XORed with the current block&#39;s plaintext to encrypt the data. The first initialization vector is a random string and each subsequent initialization vector is the ciphertext from the previous block. CBC is more secure than ECB but slower because multiple blocks can&#39;t be encrypted at the same time.</p><h3 id="cipher-feedback-mode-cfb-04-41-05-01" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#cipher-feedback-mode-cfb-04-41-05-01"><span>Cipher Feedback Mode (CFB) 04:41-05:01</span></a></h3><p>Cipher Feedback Mode, or CFB, also utilizes an initialization vector. But instead of using it on the plaintext, the initialization vector is encrypted and then that result is XORed with the plaintext to create the ciphertext block. This is the equivalent of encrypting the plaintext with a one-time pad.</p><h3 id="output-feedback-mode-ofb-05-01-05-30" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#output-feedback-mode-ofb-05-01-05-30"><span>Output Feedback Mode (OFB) 05:01-05:30</span></a></h3><p>Output Feedback Mode, or OFB, is practically identical to Cipher Feedback Mode. The difference is the initialization vector used after the first round of encryption. The CFB&#39;s output is XORed with the plaintext and the result is the next block&#39;s initialization vector. The process is the same in Output Feedback Mode, except that the encryption&#39;s output is the next block&#39;s initialization vector before it&#39;s XORed with the plaintext.</p><h3 id="counter-mode-05-30-06-08" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#counter-mode-05-30-06-08"><span>Counter Mode 05:30-06:08</span></a></h3><p>Next we have Counter Mode. Similar to ECB, every encryption process in Counter Mode is separate. Instead of using an initialization vector, Counter Mode uses a nonce combined with an encrypted counter. Nonce is simply a fancy word for a random string that&#39;s used for all blocks. The nonce&#39;s encrypted output and counter are then XORed with the plaintext to create the ciphertext. The counter starts at 0 and increments every block. By combining the nonce and counter, each block is using a different value so that even if the data is the same, the output will be different.</p><h3 id="galois-counter-mode-gcm-06-08-07-03" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#galois-counter-mode-gcm-06-08-07-03"><span>Galois Counter Mode (GCM) 06:08-07:03</span></a></h3><p>If we want to provide authentication with confidentiality, we can use the Galois Counter Mode, or GCM. This mode works just like Counter Mode. First, we have the counter and nonce encrypted. The output is XOR-ed with the plaintext to give us the ciphertext. Here&#39;s where things get different. The ciphertext is combined with a special hash. That output contains the ciphertext along with a message authentication code that gives us assurance that the data hasn&#39;t been tampered with. Because this method is efficient and provides authentication, we see it used often with network communications such as wireless networks and web servers that use SSH or TLS.</p><p>The other block cipher modes are classified as unauthenticated encryption and GCM is classified as authenticated encryption.

Homomorphic encryption addresses this concern by allowing encrypted data to be used without decrypting it first.

Homomorphic encryption works like other asymmetric encryption methods by using a public key to encrypt the data and a private key to decrypt it.</p><p>It helps to look at data as math problems to better understand the differences in the types of homomorphic encryption.</p><p>There are three types of homomorphic encryption: Partially homomorphic, which allows for only simple mathematical operations like addition and subtraction to be performed; somewhat homomorphic, which allows for more complex math such as multiplication to occur but only for a limited number of times; and fully homomorphic, which can handle any mathematical operation an unlimited number of times. Homomorphic Encryption has the potential to be a game changer, but as of now it&#39;s incredibly slow and inefficient.</p><h3 id="summary-08-53-09-23" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#summary-08-53-09-23"><span>Summary 08:53-09:23</span></a></h3><p>That&#39;s it for this lesson. In this lesson, we looked at the different ciphers used in cryptography. We first examined the stream cipher which encrypts data one bit at a time. Then we looked at how block ciphers work and the different operation modes. Finally, we looked at two newer forms of cryptography. Lightweight cryptography is being designed for IoT devices and homomorphic encryption allows data to be used without having to decrypt it.</p><h2 id="_7-1-7-cryptography-algorithms-facts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_7-1-7-cryptography-algorithms-facts"><span>7.1.7 Cryptography Algorithms Facts</span></a></h2><p>The cornerstone of all cryptography is the algorithm, or cipher. There are different types of ciphers in use today.</p><p>This lesson covers the following topics:</p><ul><li> Stream cipher </li><li> Block cipher </li><li> Lightweight cryptography </li><li> Homomorphic encryption </li></ul><h3 id="stream-cipher" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#stream-cipher"><span>Stream Cipher</span></a></h3><p>A stream cipher is a symmetric encryption method that encrypts data one bit at a time. The stream cipher is based on the one-time pad (OTP) concept, which was used extensively during World War 2. Consider the following OTP characteristics:</p><ul><li> The OTP uses a symmetric encryption key that is the same length as the data being encrypted. </li><li> The encryption key is used to encrypt the data using a process called XORing. This means that two binary strings are compared. If the bits match, a 0 is generated. If the bits don&#39;t match, a 1 is generated. The output of the XOR process is the ciphertext. </li><li> The OTP demonstrates what is called perfect secrecy. This means that it is just as, if not more, difficult for a hacker to brute-force the key as it would be to brute-force the data itself. </li><li> The OTP only provides perfect secrecy if the secret key is only used once. If used more than once, a hacker could begin to decode it. </li><li> OTP works well when dealing with small messages, but it becomes impractical when dealing with large data due to the keys being so extensive. </li></ul><p>A stream cipher solves the problem of having excessively large keys associated with OTP by using a smaller, fixed-length seed key such as one that is 2048 bits in length. The following describes the process of creating a seed key:</p><ol><li> The seed key is run through a pseudorandom number generator which outputs a new and unique encryption key that is the same size as the data being encrypted. This new key is called a keystream. </li><li> The keystream is XORed with the data to create the ciphertext. </li><li> The seed key can be used repeatedly throughout the encryption process. </li></ol><p>While stream ciphers are less secure than the one-time pad, this method can actually be used in real time. One of the most widely used stream ciphers was Rivest&#39;s Cipher 4 (RC4). However, multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in RC4, rendering it insecure. It is no longer used today.</p><h3 id="block-cipher" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#block-cipher"><span>Block Cipher</span></a></h3><p>Many symmetric encryption algorithms use the block cipher method. Instead of encrypting our data one bit at a time, a block cipher encrypts the data one chunk at a time. Common block sizes are 64, 128, or 256 bits in length. For example, when encrypting a piece of data that is 100 bytes in size using a 256-bit block size, the data would be encrypted 32 bytes at a time (256 bits/8 = 32 bytes). Because the last block is less than 32 bytes, extra random bits are added to bring the block up to 32 bytes.</p><p>There are 6 block cipher modes of operation that can be utilized depending on the application or use:</p>',62),e("table",null,[e("thead",null,[e("tr",null,[e("th",{class_:"firstTableHeader",scope:"col",class:"fw-bold"}," Mode of Operation "),e("th",{scope:"col",class:"fw-bold"}," Description ")])]),e("tbody",null,[e("tr",null,[e("td",null,[t(" Electronic Code Book "),e("br"),t(" (ECB) ")]),e("td",null,[t(" ECB is the simplest mode of operation.

This attack&#39;s name is taken from the birthday probability math problem.</p><p>If you have 30 people are in a room, the chance that someone has the same birthday as you is about 8 percent. But the probability that any two people in the room have the same birthday is 70 percent. This is because we&#39;re not looking for an exact match, just any match. This concept can be used to create two documents with the same hash, as in the collision attack example.</p><h3 id="downgrade-attack-02-21-03-23" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#downgrade-attack-02-21-03-23"><span>Downgrade Attack 02:21-03:23</span></a></h3><p>Another popular attack is the downgrade attack. These attacks are often used as part of the man-in-the-middle method. Downgrade attacks force the system to use an older, less secure protocol for communication.</p><p>A common example of this attack is SSL exploitation. Many servers have both SSL and TLS installed on them. If a client can&#39;t use TLS, then the server can revert to SSL. A hacker can set up their computer to only use SSL, which will then allow them to launch SSL-based attacks on the server.</p><p>Another common example is a man-in-the-middle attack. In this attack, the hacker intercepts the HTTPS packets and reverts them to HTTP packets. If the server isn&#39;t configured properly, it&#39;ll respond using HTTP, which allows the hacker to see everything being sent back and forth.</p><p>To combat these attacks, it&#39;s imperative that servers don&#39;t support older, less secure protocols. Proper server configuration is the key to stopping these types of attacks.</p><h3 id="quantum-cryptography-03-23-04-01" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#quantum-cryptography-03-23-04-01"><span>Quantum Cryptography 03:23-04:01</span></a></h3><p>Now let&#39;s look ahead to what&#39;s coming in the security world.
