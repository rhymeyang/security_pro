Whether it&#39;s misconfigured devices, weak security configurations, default settings, outdated firmware, or other exploits, these vulnerabilities serve as a prime target for accessing valuable information. Let&#39;s discuss some of these vulnerabilities.</p><h3 id="misconfigured-devices-00-22-01-17" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#misconfigured-devices-00-22-01-17"><span>Misconfigured Devices 00:22-01:17</span></a></h3><p>Misconfigured devices, such as firewalls, content filters, or access points, can serve as an entry point into an organization. Firewalls that have too many ports open may allow unwanted traffic to specific programs or devices. This external access allows a wider range of potential exploitation.</p><p>If content filters are not used or misconfigured, traffic like SPAM or questionable websites with potentially malicious links or payloads may expose employees to malware attacks that lead to a loss of sensitive data.</p><p>Misconfigured access points with lax security can allow an outsider to access a corporate network as if they were a company employee. Training is essential for systems administrators and security professionals to accurately configure devices so that only approved personnel are permitted to access ports, programs, accounts, and devices.</p><h3 id="weak-security-configuration-01-17-02-57" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#weak-security-configuration-01-17-02-57"><span>Weak Security Configuration 01:17-02:57</span></a></h3><p>Alongside misconfigured devices, weak security configurations can also expose a company&#39;s infrastructure and data to malicious attacks. Weak configurations can be devices running old or outdated protocols. For example, an access point configured to run with WEP is an immediate security vulnerability. Another example of this is sites using SHA-1 certificates.</p><p>SHA-1 was a commonly used hashing algorithm, but now is considered insecure. In fact, many modern browsers are rejecting these certificates because of the vulnerability they pose to having presumably encrypted data intercepted and decrypted.</p><p>Perhaps there is no greater risk in the security world than systems administrators who use default settings or passwords on a device. Attackers can simply access Google to learn the default credentials to most common makes and models of devices. Once an attacker determines the make and model of a device, it&#39;s easy to compromise if a systems administrator hasn&#39;t changed the default credentials.</p><p>Many device manufacturers are now shipping devices with customized usernames and passwords, but there are still far too many devices that retain the defaults. When you install a new network device, check to see if the device has default accounts and passwords. If so, change these factory defaults.</p><p>Some default configurations also need to be altered. For instance, some access points ship without the encryption set. In general, however, the recent trend is for manufacturers to lock down or disable services and require that administrators explicitly change the factory defaults.</p><h3 id="outdated-firmware-02-57-03-46" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#outdated-firmware-02-57-03-46"><span>Outdated Firmware 02:57-03:46</span></a></h3><p>Systems administrators also need to ensure that devices have up-to-date firmware and operating systems, and that software has the latest patches. For example, in 2014, the Heartbleed bug took advantage of systems with an older version of the popular OpenSSL cryptography library.</p><p>More recently, in 2017, WannaCry ransomware ransacked the internet, holding peoples&#39; data hostage by taking advantage of default settings in several operating systems that had SMB version 1 enabled by default. Most manufacturers release updated firmware and patches to protect against widespread vulnerabilities. However, in many cases, administrators must explicitly apply new firmware or patches to be protected.</p><h3 id="hardcoded-credentials-03-46-04-29" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#hardcoded-credentials-03-46-04-29"><span>Hardcoded Credentials 03:46-04:29</span></a></h3><p>Hard coded passwords are another infrastructure vulnerability, especially if some services share the password. If the password is the same across your devices or software, then every customer is vulnerable in a hacking situation. Additionally, hard coded passwords are often troublesome to update regularly.</p><p>Another variant of this vulnerability is when accounts are more accessible than necessary. For example, many developers use a single super user password to connect to an entire database rather than restricting portions of the database required for specific functionality. If this password is compromised, then hackers can access the complete database, rather than a subset of the data.</p><h3 id="easy-physical-access-04-29-05-14" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#easy-physical-access-04-29-05-14"><span>Easy Physical Access 04:29-05:14</span></a></h3><p>Protecting infrastructure also includes protecting physical access to individual components. If an attacker can gain physical access, typically, they can reset passwords and enter the critical systems of an infrastructure. For example, adding an administrative account on a Windows 10 server is relatively straightforward with physical access. Similarly, bypassing required passwords to access privileged mode on a Cisco router is easy if you have physical access to the device. Ensuring that only specific software and services are allowed on your infrastructure and changing the default passwords and configurations will cut down on exploits. However, if physical access to infrastructure isn&#39;t restricted, then those protections are useless.</p><h3 id="zero-days-and-cves-05-14-06-16" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#zero-days-and-cves-05-14-06-16"><span>Zero Days and CVEs 05:14-06:16</span></a></h3><p>When vendors create software or firmware for devices, it sometimes contains code that can be exploited. When these vulnerabilities are unknown to the vendor and exploited in the wild, they are referred to as zero-day vulnerabilities. Once the vulnerability is discovered and patched, the exploit is no-longer referred to as a zero-day exploit. Rather, these are called known exploits.</p><p>However, keeping track of vulnerabilities throughout their lifecycle is important. There have been a handful of initiatives to catalog and standardize names for zero-day exploits or other vulnerabilities. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures, or CVE, database is a popular repository hosted by MITRE Corporation. On this database, security professionals can download lists of known CVEs, submit new findings, and update information about an existing CVE. NIST, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, also maintains a national vulnerability database.</p><h3 id="summary-06-16-06-56" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#summary-06-16-06-56"><span>Summary 06:16-06:56</span></a></h3><p>In summary, an enterprise needs to protect its infrastructure and can do so by ensuring that no outdated firmware, default passwords, default configurations, or weak security settings are used. Additionally, systems administrators need to make sure that software patches are applied in a timely manner and that bad software development practices, like hard coded passwords, are avoided. Additionally, physical access is critical to securing an infrastructure. Security professionals need to be aware of the resources for cataloging and identifying common vulnerabilities and exposures.</p><h2 id="_2-4-2-vulnerability-concerns-facts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-4-2-vulnerability-concerns-facts"><span>2.4.2 Vulnerability Concerns Facts</span></a></h2><p>A knowledgeable attacker can exploit network device vulnerabilities to gain access to network resources.</p><p>This lesson covers the following topics:</p><ul><li>Network Vulnerabilities</li><li>Adversarial Artificial Intelligence</li></ul><h3 id="network-vulnerabilities" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#network-vulnerabilities"><span>Network Vulnerabilities</span></a></h3><p>The following table describes common network vulnerabilities.</p>',32),e("table",null,[e("thead",null,[e("tr",null,[e("th",{class_:"firstTableHeader",scope:"col",class:"fw-bold"}," Vulnerability "),e("th",{scope:"col",class:"fw-bold"}," Description ")])]),e("tbody",null,[e("tr",null,[e("td",null," Default accounts and passwords "),e("td",null," Default accounts and passwords are factory defaults that are pre-configured for a new network device.

There are others, too--these are just a few examples.</p><p>As an IT administrator, keep an eye on any unusual activity in your network. Educating the company&#39;s employees is also helpful for catching identity theft attempts.</p><h3 id="availability-loss-03-27-04-02" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#availability-loss-03-27-04-02"><span>Availability Loss 03:27-04:02</span></a></h3><p>The last vulnerability exploit I&#39;ll mention in this lesson is availability loss.</p><p>Availability means systems work promptly and service is accessible to users. So, from a security standpoint, availability loss is when an attacker performs a malicious act to make the network so busy that the system goes down, usually through malware. When this happens, employees are kept from their work or are unable to accomplish their tasks. Customers are also unable to access the company&#39;s services. This costs the company time, money, and a lot of frustration.</p><h3 id="summary-04-02-04-29" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#summary-04-02-04-29"><span>Summary 04:02-04:29</span></a></h3><p>As you can see, it&#39;s very important to properly secure networks against vulnerabilities.
