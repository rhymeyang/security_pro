So to be fully prepared, network defenders should be proactive and implement threat hunting.</p><p>Threat hunting is the human-based, methodical search of a network, system, or software in order to detect suspicious activity that might&#39;ve evaded the automated tools.</p><p>The first step in threat hunting is for you to understand the different types of threats that are out there. Thankfully, there are many tools available.

These advisories give a more detailed look than threat feeds do. One of the more popular bulletins is the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency&#39;s, or CISA&#39;s, weekly bulletin that provides a summary of new vulnerabilities that are reported by the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the National Vulnerability Database.</p><h3 id="intelligence-fusion-01-41-02-18" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#intelligence-fusion-01-41-02-18"><span>Intelligence Fusion 01:41-02:18</span></a></h3><p>Threat feeds and bulletins both rely on information being shared between different government agencies, like the DHS, FBI, and private security firms. This sharing of information is known as intelligence fusion. One example of this in action is state-to-state fusion centers. These centers gather local threat information and share it with other fusion centers in other states.</p><p>Staying updated with the latest threats allows us to maneuver ourselves to defend against them. This includes implementing proper safeguards to prevent attacks we might be vulnerable to.

Most vulnerability scanning programs allow us to specify what we test and how the test is performed.</p><p>Vulnerability scans aren&#39;t only used on network and host systems. We should run our scans on local applications and web applications as well. Many times, these applications have vulnerabilities that allow a hacker access to our network.

An intrusive scan finds the potential vulnerability and then actively tries to exploit it. This leads to more accurate results, but it obviously can&#39;t be done on a live production system. A non-intrusive scan is the more common option. This method scans the network and lists all potential vulnerabilities. The downside is that the scan can&#39;t confirm whether the system is actually vulnerable or not. These scans can be performed on a live production system, but the network defender will need to take additional actions to verify the findings.</p><h3 id="credentialed-and-non-credentialed-scans-03-23-03-56" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#credentialed-and-non-credentialed-scans-03-23-03-56"><span>Credentialed and Non-Credentialed Scans 03:23-03:56</span></a></h3><p>We also need to decide whether to run a non-credentialed or credentialed scan. A non-credentialed scan shows open ports, protocols, and services that are exposed on our host system. This shows vulnerabilities that an outside attacker might be able to take advantage of. Unfortunately for us, these scans really only give us a surface view. A credentialed scan usually uses an administrator&#39;s account, which ends up giving us a much deeper look at our network. These scans can be more difficult to manage in a large organization, though, because we would need credentials for each host.</p><h3 id="false-positives-and-false-negatives-03-56-04-33" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#false-positives-and-false-negatives-03-56-04-33"><span>False Positives and False Negatives 03:56-04:33</span></a></h3><p>When we run our scans, we need to look out for false positives and false negatives that might pop up. A false positive is when the scan says there&#39;s a vulnerability, but there&#39;s really not. False positives are just one of those things that happen, and we should be able to weed them out with our follow-up. False negatives occur when our scan misses a vulnerability that actually does exist. These might happen when our scan configurations aren&#39;t set up properly.</p><p>To help protect against these misleading results, we should always run multiple vulnerability scans with different configurations.

The trigger can be almost anything including: <ul><li> An alert from the IDS/IPS or another security device. </li><li> A hypothesis about a possible problem.

More than just aggregating data, SIEM systems can also actively read all this information and determine if there&#39;s an actual threat! Let&#39;s see how this works.</p><p>Everything starts with the collectors. Log collectors are responsible for gathering event logs from security appliances, host systems, and applications. We can also add sensors to the system in order to capture network packets or data inputs from all the disparate systems on our network. This data is sent to the event collectors, and the event collectors send it all to the SIEM.</p><p>SIEM software takes this data, reads and analyzes it, and separates it into different categories such as logon attempts, database entries, port scans, network congestion, and more. You can review the reports to help find any suspicious network activity.</p><p>If data exceeds the defined thresholds of normal network activity, the SIEM sends an alert to the security administrator, who then can investigate it and take care of the threat as needed.</p><h3 id="next-generation-siem-01-46-02-13" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#next-generation-siem-01-46-02-13"><span>Next-Generation SIEM 01:46-02:13</span></a></h3><p>The next generation of SIEM systems are taking things to the next level.

Let&#39;s break this down and see how these systems work.</p><p>SOAR systems gather the same information as SIEM systems do, but they also gather data from multiple third-party tools. The SOAR system coordinates these tools, sensors, and collectors to work together to gather as much relevant data as possible. This is the orchestration piece of a SOAR system.</p><p>You can set up a SOAR system to automate tasks that are routine, tedious, and time consuming, such as looking for and deleting phishing emails. This is usually configured using checklists called playbooks or a series of conditional steps called runbooks. Automating these tasks frees up time for your security team to focus on more important things.</p><p>Finally, a SOAR system is able to automatically respond to threats. For example, if malware is discovered, a SOAR system can identify the threat and quarantine it instead of just sending an alert.</p><p>SOAR systems help to reduce a security operation team&#39;s workload by automating workflows and handling low-level tasks automatically. You should use both SIEM and SOAR systems for improved security. Your SOAR system can likely respond to the low-level threats that the SIEM system uncovers, and your security team can take responsibility for the higher-level issues.</p><h3 id="summary-03-58-04-34" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#summary-03-58-04-34"><span>Summary 03:58-04:34</span></a></h3><p>That&#39;ll wrap things up for now.

You can configure SOAR systems to automate basic tasks that take up your organization&#39;s valuable time. Using both systems can greatly improve your network security.</p><h2 id="_11-4-4-siem-and-soar-facts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_11-4-4-siem-and-soar-facts"><span>11.4.4 SIEM and SOAR Facts</span></a></h2><p>Multiple automated systems, such as IDS/IPS, firewalls, and security policies are implemented to protect networks.

Typically, you scan for a specific purpose, often to look for vulnerabilities. Vulnerability scanning attempts to find points that can be exploited on a computer or network.</p><p>A vulnerability scan can detect and sometimes classify system weaknesses in computers, networks, and other equipment. The scan can also predict the effectiveness of countermeasures that you might implement. A scan may be performed by an IT department or someone hired to perform a penetration test. There are several good tools that perform vulnerability scanning. But if you&#39;re on a budget, you can use nmap with a script, the Nmap Scripting Engine, to do a vulnerability scan.</p><h3 id="get-the-nmap-script-00-43-01-44" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#get-the-nmap-script-00-43-01-44"><span>Get the Nmap Script 00:43-01:44</span></a></h3><p>I&#39;m on a Kali Linux system. This system comes with a whole bunch of scripts, but the one we want isn&#39;t included. That&#39;s not a problem; we can go out to the web and find it. To get the script, we&#39;ll go to Github.</p><p>I&#39;ve already located the web page with the script. This is the one that we want. I&#39;ll open that link. Down here, in the description, it says that the script uses some well-known service to provide information about vulnerabilities. That&#39;s really not a great description, but I happen to know that it works pretty well.</p><p>To get the script, you need to click on this Clone or Download link and copy the address. Now, we&#39;ll open the terminal, type in &#39;git clone&#39;, paste in the rest of the address, and press Enter on the keyboard. I&#39;ve already done that, so I won&#39;t do it again.</p><p>When I was doing this, I wasn&#39;t paying attention, and it went into the root directory, so I had to go in and move it to the /usr/share/nmap/scripts directory so nmap knows where to find it by default. If you have some basic Linux skills, it shouldn&#39;t be a problem to move to the directory before downloading the script.</p><h3 id="run-the-script-01-44-03-18" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#run-the-script-01-44-03-18"><span>Run the Script 01:44-03:18</span></a></h3><p>All right. On my network, I have a Windows 10 system, and I&#39;ve installed XAMPP on it with some web pages, php, forms, and so on. I want to put it out there facing the public internet. But I&#39;m not sure if it has any vulnerabilities. This is my example. I could also have other systems that I can scan. But for this demo, I&#39;m just going to scan this particular system.</p><p>Since I&#39;m familiar with this system, I already know the IP address. To begin, I want to just do a regular service scan with nmap to see what we get. For that, I&#39;ll type in &#39;nmap -sV 10.10.10.195&#39; and press Enter. It takes a few seconds to get the results. When it&#39;s done, you can see that I have a few open ports and services running. As I already mentioned, this system is running a web server, Apache, along with other services, so I&#39;m concerned about it. Now let&#39;s run this scan with the script.</p><p>To run the script, we&#39;ll type &#39;nmap - -script nmap-vulners -sV 10.10.10.195&#39; and press Enter. This will take a few seconds.</p><p>The scan is done. Now we have some additional information. Right here, we have some information under Apache and port 443. I&#39;m going to hold down the Ctrl key and click on this hyperlink. It&#39;ll open Firefox, and I&#39;ll go to the page where I can read more about this particular vulnerability. I&#39;ll scroll down. Under the description, it tells me exactly what this issue is. It looks like someone could execute some code, so it&#39;s probably not something I want to let loose on the web until I do more research and fix any problems.</p><h3 id="other-scripts-03-18-03-36" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#other-scripts-03-18-03-36"><span>Other Scripts 03:18-03:36</span></a></h3><p>While we&#39;re in Firefox, let&#39;s jump back over to the Github tab. I&#39;ll go back a page. There are other scripts here that do some additional scans. If you have a test environment (and you should), you can download others and see what type of results you can get. Remember that you can run multiple scripts in one scan.</p><h3 id="summary-03-36-04-02" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#summary-03-36-04-02"><span>Summary 03:36-04:02</span></a></h3><p>That&#39;s it for this demo. In this demo, we used nmap and the Nmap Scripting Engine to do a vulnerability scan on a Windows 10 system running XAMPP. First, we went to Github to locate the scripts we needed. Then we did a regular service scan with nmap. We did another scan using the script, and then we used the web to learn more about one of the vulnerabilities that the script found.</p><h2 id="_11-4-6-scanning-a-network-with-nessus" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_11-4-6-scanning-a-network-with-nessus"><span>11.4.6 Scanning a Network with Nessus</span></a></h2><h3 id="scan-a-network-with-nessus-00-00-00-26" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scan-a-network-with-nessus-00-00-00-26"><span>Scan a Network with Nessus 00:00-00:26</span></a></h3><p>In this demonstration, we&#39;re going to work with the Nessus Vulnerability Scanner. Nessus is a very powerful security tool that you can use to scan for security vulnerabilities on your network.</p><p>Nessus is accessed via a web page on port 8834. I&#39;ve installed Nessus on this machine, so I&#39;m just connecting to localhost. For this demo, I&#39;m running an evaluation copy of Nessus, but that&#39;s sufficient to show what it can do.</p><h3 id="create-a-scan-00-26-01-28" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#create-a-scan-00-26-01-28"><span>Create a Scan 00:26-01:28</span></a></h3><p>Let&#39;s start by logging in. After I log in, we see the home page. Here, we can see the various scans that have already been created. There are many different features and options in Nessus, but for this demo, I&#39;ll stick to showing how to create and run a network scan.</p><p>While I could create a custom scan profile, Nessus includes quite a few useful templates that can accomplish most of what I typically need. To create a scan, I&#39;ll start by selecting New Scan from the top right. Here, we can see some of the templates I mentioned. I&#39;m going to run a basic network scan, so I&#39;ll select that template. This template scans a specified host or network range for known vulnerabilities.</p><p>To set up the scan, I&#39;ll need to provide a name for it, as well as a network address that I&#39;d like to scan. I&#39;m going to name this &#39;home gateway scan&#39; since I&#39;ll be scanning the computers at my house with it. My gateway is located at 10.0.0.1, so that&#39;s what I&#39;ll supply as the target. There are many other options that I could configure, including port discovery and authenticated scanning, but I just want to do a simple scan today. Since everything I need is configured, I&#39;ll click Save.</p><h3 id="scan-01-28-02-02" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scan-01-28-02-02"><span>Scan 01:28-02:02</span></a></h3><p>Now that I&#39;ve returned to the home page, I can see that the new scan has been created, but isn&#39;t running yet. I can click Launch to start it.</p><p>The scan&#39;s title changes to bold, and a spinning green icon appears to show that the scan is active. I can watch the scan live by clicking on it. This screen shows information about the different hosts that are discovered and the vulnerabilities that are found. Nessus also keeps a historical log of all the times a scan has been run so that I can compare how vulnerabilities have improved on my network over time.</p><p>This scan is going to take a while, so I&#39;ll pause the demo until it&#39;s finished.</p><h3 id="scan-results-02-02-03-01" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scan-results-02-02-03-01"><span>Scan Results 02:02-03:01</span></a></h3><p>Now that the scan has finished, we can see that my gateway has quite a few vulnerabilities. Luckily, most of them are labelled as informational. This means that the tool found information that could be useful for a security administrator to know about a host, but that the information doesn&#39;t immediately indicate a problem. An example of the type of data that would be labelled as informational is a list of open network ports. Network ports have to be open on some machines for them to function properly, but opening unexpected ports can cause problems.</p><p>More serious vulnerabilities are color-coded from green to red. Low-severity vulnerabilities aren&#39;t as interesting as high or critical vulnerabilities, so I&#39;ll take a look at one of the worst issues Nessus found.</p><p>When I select a vulnerability, it shows me information about the issue. In many cases, software creators patch high and critical vulnerabilities, and a relevant CVE entry is listed. Nessus provide a description and a suggested solution for many issues, as well as relevant information related to the vulnerability.</p><h3 id="summary-03-01-03-17" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#summary-03-01-03-17"><span>Summary 03:01-03:17</span></a></h3><p>And that&#39;s it for this demo. We discussed how to conduct a vulnerability scan with Nessus. We looked at what Nessus is and what it does.
