Additionally, we highly recommend that you use the certification practice exam to prepare for the Security+ SY0-601 exam.</p><p>The questions on certification exams are protected to maintain the integrity of the exam. While the practice exam does not include the exact questions, it will help measure your understanding of the topics covered in the CompTIA objectives. You should review the Security+ SY0-601 exam objectives and make sure you are comfortable with each topic and objective listed. After you take the practice exam, the objectives for the exam are listed on the Report screen.

The certification practice exam is the best way to prepare for taking the certification exam. The content of the objectives for an exam are more comprehensive than any single adaptive test. Adaptive tests are too short to give you a thorough review and the chance to practice taking the test. You need to understand all of the questions before you take the certification exam.</p><p>An adaptive exam begins by giving you an easy-to-moderate question. If you answer the question correctly, it gives you a more difficult question. With each correct answer, the difficulty of the next question increases. On the other hand, if you answer the second question incorrectly, the next questions will be easier. The test changes the question difficulty until it determines your skill level.</p><p>There are two primary characteristics you will notice as you take an adaptive exam:</p><ol><li>You cannot skip questions or review previously answered questions. This means that you need to take more time to answer each question carefully before going on to the next question. Adaptive exams display a warning screen at the beginning of the exam stating that you will not be allowed to review previous questions.</li><li>Adaptive tests are typically shorter than traditional exams. The current adaptive exams range between 15 and 35 questions.</li></ol><h3 id="how-is-the-exam-administered" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-is-the-exam-administered"><span>How is the exam administered?</span></a></h3><p>Certification exams are all computer-based.
