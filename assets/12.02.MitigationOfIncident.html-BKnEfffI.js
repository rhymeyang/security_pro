Endpoints include laptops, PCs, servers, smartphones, or any other device that connects to your network. Reconfiguring endpoint protection is an ongoing protection process which consists of whitelists, blacklists, and quarantines. In this lesson, we&#39;ll discuss what each of these terms mean and the role they play in network security.</p><h3 id="whitelists-00-30-01-27" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#whitelists-00-30-01-27"><span>Whitelists 00:30-01:27</span></a></h3><p>Whitelisting allows an IT admin to control the applications, IP addresses, URLs, and email addresses that are allowed onto the network. Whitelisting can be done at the firewall level, the email-server level, or with applications that automate your updates and virus protection. Whitelisting is a great tool, but it&#39;s much more labor-intensive than blacklisting. It also creates the possibility that a needed application may get blocked and interrupt workflow.</p><p>Remember that whitelisting denies access to everything that&#39;s not on the whitelist. This is called implicit deny. It&#39;s one of the strictest access control measures.</p><p>Let&#39;s take a look at how whitelisting actually works. When a packet or other request arrives at a network, the whitelist is checked to see if the packet has been approved. If it&#39;s not on the list, the network drops it. If the packet is on the list, it&#39;s then sent on its way.</p><h3 id="blacklists-01-27-02-38" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#blacklists-01-27-02-38"><span>Blacklists 01:27-02:38</span></a></h3><p>Blacklisting is the opposite of whitelisting. An IT admin can list the IP addresses, URLs, and email addresses that are to be blocked from the network. This is done at the firewall level, the email-server level, or with applications, just like whitelisting. Blacklisting is considered easier to implement since the lists tend to be smaller. It&#39;s also possible to subscribe to blacklists produced by security companies. These lists are usually updated regularly. These subscription blacklists are compiled from thousands of companies that report malicious applications, IP addresses, and email addresses, which makes setting up a blacklist a more automated process. A best practice for utilizing blacklisting is to integrate a next-generation security platform that offers a cloud-based master threat database.</p><p>Here&#39;s what happens with blacklisting: When a packet or other request arrives at the network, the network checks the master database of blacklisted items. If an item is on the list, it may be destroyed or even sent to quarantine. If the packet isn&#39;t identified in the master database, it&#39;s allowed into the network.</p><h3 id="quarantines-02-38-03-27" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#quarantines-02-38-03-27"><span>Quarantines 02:38-03:27</span></a></h3><p>Since endpoints are a prominent attack place, they become pivot points into deeper network assets when attacked. When the antivirus program finds a malicious item, it quarantines it. This means that the item is placed into a folder where it can&#39;t cause any damage to the network. If it&#39;s eventually found to be non-malicious, it can be released.</p><p>It&#39;s also possible to quarantine the endpoint itself. If this is done, the endpoint is no longer able to receive any network traffic. This can be problematic if the attacked endpoint is a server or proxy server. A quarantined proxy server is a worst-case scenario, as the assets that sit behind it on the network are all blocked.</p><p>Quarantining picks up where blacklisting ends. The quarantine lasts indefinitely unless an IT admin approves a release.</p><h3 id="summary-03-27-04-17" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#summary-03-27-04-17"><span>Summary 03:27-04:17</span></a></h3><p>That&#39;s it for this lesson.

A blacklist blocks the items on it from getting to network endpoints.

This can be accomplished in a few different ways. One way is to practice process isolation. This ensures that if a process is compromised, only the resources used by that process are at risk. This practice applies to operating systems as well as RAM. In other words, it prevents any process that is limited by access bounds from accessing the resources of another process. This is a trait of a stable operating system. Isolation is considered a preventative security measure since it&#39;s implemented before an event is detected.</p><h3 id="containment-00-49-01-53" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#containment-00-49-01-53"><span>Containment 00:49-01:53</span></a></h3><p>Containment is the first step after an event has been detected and identified. This action can take a few forms. An IT admin may disconnect a machine from the network by simply unplugging the Ethernet cable or disabling the NIC. If this network is connected to other networks, this connection may be terminated. The decision to disconnect must be weighed against the amount of data being compromised and the potential loss of forensic evidence. No matter what, the goal of containment is to limit the damage potential of malicious activity.</p><p>Containment requires action. Once an IT security analyst detects and identifies a malicious event, they must act. In this scenario, the analyst is monitoring a physical server that must be manually disconnected from network. This means the on-site IT Admin must jump into action as quickly as possible. Time is of the essence since this event threatens the physical server and also the servers in the branch office. This is because the two networks are connected via a VPN. Containment requires that the damage be limited—even if it means taking a server down.</p><h3 id="segmentation-01-53-02-41" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#segmentation-01-53-02-41"><span>Segmentation 01:53-02:41</span></a></h3><p>Segmentation is a strategic network design.

Rules must be implemented to control what kind of communications can occur between assets on the network. Many times, a network admin will create a DMZ.
