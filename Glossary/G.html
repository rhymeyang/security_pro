It provides object-oriented programming, and can be used to develop applications that can stand alone. Java is type-safe, supports only single inheritance, and includes supports for concurrency. Java runs in self-contained platforms called <i>sandboxes</i>. All activity in a sandbox is checked against the following mechanisms: </p><ul><li> A verifier, which primarily deals with memory and bounds checking to help to ensure type safety. </li><li> A class loader, which loads and unloads classes from the Java runtime environment dynamically. </li><li> A security manager, which protects against rogue-like functions by acting as a security gate-keeper. </li></ul><p> The weakness of the three-part model is that if one mechanism fails to operate, the entire model is compromised. Other things to know about Java are: </p><ul><li> Java verifies the validity of execution demands through internal checks called <i class="fs-italicize">s</i>tatic type checking. </li><li> Java is platform-independent. Each platform has its own version of what is known as a sandbox. A sandbox is a protective area for program execution where limits are placed on the amount of processor resources and memory that the program can assume. </li><li> Bytecode is used to build java applets that run inside the sandbox. </li><li> A Java applet acts as though it is abstracted from the operating system, thus not allowing an application to access vital information. </li><li> If the sandbox limits are violated, the Web browser will terminate the process and log an error code. </li><li> Because the sandbox is a virtual machine, it is vulnerable to malicious code in the form of an applet that is programmed to break outside of the sandbox into the host operating system. Better security is provided by isolating trusted applets from untrusted applets.

A good security plan looks to protect sources of electricity from failure or disruption. </p></div></td></tr><tr class="glsTerm"><td class="glsKeyword"><div>UTP/STP cable</div></td><td class="glsDefinition"><div><p> UTP\STP cables are common types of twisted-pair cables used to physically connect network hardware components.
