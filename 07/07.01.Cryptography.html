To do that, you can lock down a system using multiple methods, but there&#39;s always a chance that a hacker will still get through. You can use cryptography to add an additional layer of protection and make it even more difficult for hackers to steal your data, even if they get inside.</p><p>In this video, we&#39;ll discuss what cryptography is, the basic concepts associated with cryptology, and some common cryptology methods.</p><p>Cryptography is defined as the process of writing or solving messages using a secret code.</p><h3 id="cryptography-overview-00-32-01-41" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#cryptography-overview-00-32-01-41"><span>Cryptography Overview 00:32-01:41</span></a></h3><p>Cryptography isn&#39;t new. The earliest known use of cryptography was by the Egyptians in 1900 BC to deliver messages using encryption.</p><p>Encryption is the process of converting normal text into text that makes no sense at all, which is called ciphertext. A cipher is the method, or algorithm, used to encrypt the data. I know that might sound a little confusing, since these terms are often used interchangeably, so let&#39;s look at an example using a puzzle.</p><p>When you&#39;re completing a puzzle, you normally look at the completed picture on the box and then put the pieces together to match the picture. If you wanted to disguise the puzzle from prying eyes, you could use cryptography. In this case, you could encrypt the puzzle by flipping all the pieces over and scrambling them up, so no one can see the images printed on the puzzle pieces. Then, to allow you or anyone else to put the puzzle together, you&#39;ll need a method that&#39;s only given out to certain people. That&#39;s the cipher. We&#39;ll used a numbered cipher here. Using that cipher, anyone would be able to put the puzzle together.</p><h3 id="caesar-cipher-01-41-02-07" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#caesar-cipher-01-41-02-07"><span>Caesar Cipher 01:41-02:07</span></a></h3><p>One of the most common encryption ciphers is the Caesar cipher.</p><p>This cipher was created by Julius Caesar. When he wanted to sent a secret message, Caesar would shift each letter down the alphabet by three places. Then he could safely send the message to his commanders because anyone who intercepted the message couldn&#39;t read it anyway. Since only the commanders knew the cipher was to shift the letters up the alphabet by three, only they could read it.</p><h3 id="cryptography-concepts-02-07-02-19" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#cryptography-concepts-02-07-02-19"><span>Cryptography Concepts 02:07-02:19</span></a></h3><p>Today, encryption is much more advanced than the Caesar cipher. You&#39;ll hear a lot about encryption keys, hashes, and digital signatures. To understand modern encryption, you need to understand these concepts.</p><h3 id="encryption-keys-02-19-03-05" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#encryption-keys-02-19-03-05"><span>Encryption Keys 02:19-03:05</span></a></h3><p>Let&#39;s talk about encryption keys first. We install locks on our doors to keep our homes safe. These locks require a specific key. Encryption works using the same concept. When we want to encrypt data, we use an encryption key. Encryption keys are random strings of bits that are used to lock and unlock data. These keys are generated using ciphers, such as the Advanced Encryption Standard, or AES. They ensure each key is unique and difficult to crack.</p><p>There are two types of encryption methods, symmetric and asymmetric. Symmetric encryption uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt data. Asymmetric encryption uses one key to encrypt and then a different key to decrypt. These are referred to as public and private keys.</p><h3 id="hashing-03-05-03-49" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#hashing-03-05-03-49"><span>Hashing 03:05-03:49</span></a></h3><p>When you&#39;re working with these encryption methods, different techniques are used to help safeguard your data. One technique is known as hashing.</p><p>Hashing is the process of converting one value into another using a mathematical algorithm like MD5 or SHA. Hashes have several characteristics that make them very useful. For example, hashes are deterministic, meaning that the same data being hashed always results in the same hash value. Hashes can also be created very quickly and cannot be decrypted. Likewise, it&#39;s infeasible to find two messages with the same hash value. Even a small change to a message will change the hash value so extensively that the new hash value appears uncorrelated with the old hash value.</p><h3 id="hash-applications-03-49-04-11" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#hash-applications-03-49-04-11"><span>Hash Applications 03:49-04:11</span></a></h3><p>Because of these features, hashes are used in many applications.</p><p>A hash function is often used to verify passwords. Since storing or transmitting passwords in cleartext could result in a massive security breach, most systems only store the hash of the password. When a user needs to be authenticated, the password entered by the user is hashed and compared with the stored hash.</p><h3 id="salting-the-hash-04-11-05-31" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#salting-the-hash-04-11-05-31"><span>Salting the Hash 04:11-05:31</span></a></h3><p>One of the problems with using hashed passwords is that several online sites have collected massive databases containing a hash for tens of million of possible passwords. Once a hash has been captured, it can be compared with the hashes found in the database, quickly resulting in the password used to create the hash. To keep this from happening, most hashes also incorporate something called a salt.</p><p>Salting the hash means adding a random number of characters to the password before the hash is created. For example, if this is the password to be hashed, a salt such as this may be added. This becomes the string to be hashed. Since the salt is randomly generated each time, even if the same password is used and can be varying lengths, it&#39;s virtually impossible to create a database containing all the possible salted passwords.</p><p>Hashes are also used to verify that a document hasn&#39;t been corrupted or tampered with by creating a hash for the document. When the same hash algorithm is calculated at the receiving end, the hashes should match. If not, then the data was either corrupted or tampered with during transmission and should not be trusted. In a similar fashion, hashes are also used to digitally verify a signature, like when you digitally sign an important document using the internet. In this case, only the signature is hashed instead of the entire document.</p><h3 id="cryptology-methods-05-31-06-04" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#cryptology-methods-05-31-06-04"><span>Cryptology Methods 05:31-06:04</span></a></h3><p>While there are many different cryptography methods that can be used to secure data, one of the most powerful methods used today is Elliptic Curve Cryptology, or ECC. Many websites use this method to secure connections and the data they send back and forth.</p><p>To truly understand ECC and how it works would require us to dive into some really complicated math that&#39;s beyond the scope of this lesson. For now, you just need to know that this method is the next generation of cryptology, and the algorithm used can generate smaller keys that are more secure than other cryptology methods.</p><h3 id="steganography-06-04-06-39" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#steganography-06-04-06-39"><span>Steganography 06:04-06:39</span></a></h3><p>The last encryption technique we&#39;ll discuss is call steganography. Steganography is the technique of hiding or concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video. If you&#39;ve ever used invisible ink to write a hidden message, you&#39;ve used steganography.</p><p>One method of steganography is to use a special program to hide a message in another file, such as this image. When the recipient receives the image, they can use the same software to find the hidden message. If the file is intercepted by a hacker, all they&#39;ll see is the image.</p><h3 id="summary-06-39-07-03" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#summary-06-39-07-03"><span>Summary 06:39-07:03</span></a></h3><p>That&#39;s it for this lesson. In this lesson, we discussed what cryptography is and how encryption and ciphers are used.

Hackers find ways to circumvent firewalls, IPS devices, and other security protocol put in place. Cryptography is one additional layer of defense that can be used to protect data.</p><p>This lesson covers the following topics:</p><ul><li>Cryptography overview</li><li>Cryptography concepts</li><li>Cryptography methods</li></ul><h3 id="cryptography-overview" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#cryptography-overview"><span>Cryptography Overview</span></a></h3><p>Cryptography is defined as the process of writing or solving messages using a secret code. A form of cryptography called encryption has been used throughout the ages, mainly to keep messages out of the hands of enemies. Encryption is the process of converting normal readable text into something that is unintelligible called ciphertext. A cipher is the method, or algorithm, used to encrypt or convert the data.</p><p>One of the more popular forms of encryption is the Caesar cipher. This encryption method works by shifting each letter in the alphabet a certain number of spaces to the right or left. In the example below, the cipher is shifting to the right by three letters. A becomes D, B becomes E, C becomes F, and so forth.</p><p><img src="/security_pro/images/07/shift_example.jpg" alt="Caesar cipher example"></p><p>To decrypt the message, the reader must know how many spaces to shift the letters. For example, to encrypt the word TESTOUT using the Caesar Cipher with a shift of 3 to the right, TESTOUT would become WHVWRXW.</p><p>Below is the complete Caesar cipher using a shift of three letters to the right (you can see below which letters are used when they are shifted 3 spaces):</p><p><img src="/security_pro/images/07/caesar_cipher.jpg" alt="Alphabet shifted by 3"></p><p>This is a very simple example of cryptography and is easily decrypted. With today&#39;s computing power, encryption methods used are much more complicated and powerful.</p><h3 id="cryptography-concepts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#cryptography-concepts"><span>Cryptography Concepts</span></a></h3><p>There are three main concepts to understand when dealing with today&#39;s encryption methods: encryption keys, hashing, and digital signatures.</p><table><thead><tr><th class_="firstTableHeader" scope="col" class="fw-bold"> Cryptography Concept </th><th scope="col" class="fw-bold"> Description </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td> Encryption keys </td><td> Encryption keys are used to encrypt and decrypt data. The key is a string of bits that is randomly generated using a specific cipher, such as Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). There are two types of encryption methods used with keys: symmetric and asymmetric. <br><ul><li> Symmetric encryption uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt data. </li><li> Asymmetric encryption uses one key to encrypt the data and a different key to decrypt the data. These keys are known as a public key and private key. </li></ul></td></tr><tr><td> Hashing </td><td> Hashing is the process of converting one value into another using a mathematical algorithm like MD5 or SHA. This fixed length of data is called the hash. <ul><li> Hashing is used on data that does not need to be decrypted, such as a password. </li><li> When a piece of data is run through a hashing algorithm, it always generates the same hash. If even one letter in a file has been altered, the resulting hash would be different. Because of this, hashing can be used to verify that data has not been altered during transmission. </li><li> A hash cannot be decrypted. However, when using hashing for passwords, many online sites have collected massive databases containing a hash for tens of millions (or more) of possible passwords. Once a hash has been captured, it can be compared with the hashes found in the database, quickly resulting in the password used to create the hash. </li></ul></td></tr><tr><td> Salt </td><td> Salt, or salting the hash, means that a random number of characters are added to the password before the hash is created. <p> For example, if the password to be hashed was p@ssw0rd, a salt, such as E1343135E119C253, may be added. Therefore, the string to be hashed would be p@ssw0rdE1343135E119C253. Since the salt is randomly generated each time, even if the same password is used and is of varying lengths, it’s virtually impossible to create a database containing all the possible salted passwords. </p></td></tr><tr><td> Digital signatures </td><td> By combining a user&#39;s private encryption key and a hash of the data, a user can create a digital signature. A digital signature verifies that the data is legitimate and provides non-repudiation. This means that the sender cannot deny having sent the file. </td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="cryptography-methods" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#cryptography-methods"><span>Cryptography Methods</span></a></h3><p>There are many different cryptography methods used today. One important thing to keep in mind is that all cryptography uses advanced math concepts to generate encryption keys and hashes.</p><table><thead><tr><th class_="firstTableHeader" scope="col" class="fw-bold"> Cryptography Method </th><th scope="col" class="fw-bold"> Description </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td> Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) </td><td> Elliptic Curve Cryptography is one of the newer methods being implemented. ECC is able to generate smaller keys that are more secure than most other methods. Many websites today use ECC to secure connections and data transmissions. </td></tr><tr><td> Perfect Forward Secrecy </td><td> This cryptography method is used quite often in messaging apps. Instead of the same key being used for an entire conversation or session on a website, each transmission is encrypted with a different unique key. </td></tr><tr><td> Steganography </td><td> Steganography is the technique of hiding or concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video. Special programs are often used to hide messages in media files. If a hacker intercepts the message, all they see is the media. They don&#39;t know that there is a hidden message. </td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="_7-1-3-symmetric-vs-asymmetric-encryption" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_7-1-3-symmetric-vs-asymmetric-encryption"><span>7.1.3 Symmetric vs Asymmetric Encryption</span></a></h2><h3 id="symmetric-vs-asymmetric-encryption-00-00-00-37" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#symmetric-vs-asymmetric-encryption-00-00-00-37"><span>Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Encryption 00:00-00:37</span></a></h3><p>Keeping data and messages safe from prying eyes is the goal of cybersecurity. We can hide data from hackers by encrypting it. Encryption is the process of encoding data into a format that&#39;s unreadable. All encryption relies on a unique key to encrypt and decrypt the data. This key is basically a password that&#39;s combined with the cipher to encrypt the data. In this lesson, we&#39;re going to look at some encryption methods including symmetric encryption, asymmetric encryption, hybrid cryptosystems, and ephemeral keys.</p><h3 id="symmetric-encryption-00-37-01-55" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#symmetric-encryption-00-37-01-55"><span>Symmetric Encryption 00:37-01:55</span></a></h3><p>Symmetric encryption uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt data. This is the simplest and oldest form of encryption. Let&#39;s look at how this works.</p><p>Travis has a confidential file that he needs to send to Craig. To ensure that the file is sent safely, Travis encrypts the file using his secret symmetric encryption key and sends it to Craig. To open the file, Craig must use the same encryption key to decrypt the file.</p><p>One of the biggest problems with symmetric encryption is that both parties must use the same key. If Travis and Craig send encrypted data often, they&#39;ve probably set up this secret key in advance. But if not, Travis needs to let Craig know what the secret key is. Sending the key with the data defeats the purpose because if a hacker intercepts the message, they can decrypt the file.</p><p>Imagine what a pain it would be to distribute the secret key if multiple people were to need access to it. Not only is this difficult to do, but the more people that have the key, the more likely it is for the key to be compromised.</p><p>Symmetric encryption is very secure and works extremely well when you need to encrypt a large amount of data because it requires less CPU power than asymmetric encryption.</p><h3 id="symmetric-key-algorithms-01-55-02-06" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#symmetric-key-algorithms-01-55-02-06"><span>Symmetric-Key Algorithms 01:55-02:06</span></a></h3><p>There are many symmetric-key algorithms used, but some of the more common ones are Data Encryption Standard,</p><p>Rivest Cipher, and Advanced Encryption Standard.</p><h3 id="data-encryption-standard-des-02-06-02-49" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#data-encryption-standard-des-02-06-02-49"><span>Data Encryption Standard (DES) 02:06-02:49</span></a></h3><p>The Data Encryption Standard, or DES, cipher was originally developed by IBM in the early 1970s and used heavily throughout the years. But due in part to its short key length of only 56 bits, hackers in the 1990s were able to brute-force the encryption keys. In other words, they were able to try every possible key until they found the right one. In 1998, an attempt to further secure DES was introduced. It was known as the Triple Data Encryption Algorithm, or 3DES. 3DES combined 3 keys to give it a key length of 168 bits, making it much more difficult to brute-force. Unfortunately, 3DES requires more CPU power and isn&#39;t used as much these days.</p><h3 id="rivest-cipher-rc-02-49-03-08" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#rivest-cipher-rc-02-49-03-08"><span>Rivest Cipher (RC) 02:49-03:08</span></a></h3><p>The Rivest Cipher, or RC, family of algorithms were developed by Ron Rivest in 1987. RC4 was once the most widely used cipher but is no longer supported as multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered. The latest version, RC6, is a 128-bit cipher.</p><h3 id="advanced-encryption-standard-aes-03-08-03-40" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#advanced-encryption-standard-aes-03-08-03-40"><span>Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 03:08-03:40</span></a></h3><p>The Advanced Encryption Standard, or AES, has for the most part replaced all other types of symmetric encryption. AES is a subset of the Rijndael block cipher, developed by Vincent Rijmen and Jaon Daemen. It was developed in 2001 during a competition run by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST. AES offers three key lengths of 128, 192, or 256 bits. AES is used in all sorts of ways including 802.11 communication, BitLocker, and even some games engines.</p><h3 id="other-symmetric-algorithms-03-40-03-53" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#other-symmetric-algorithms-03-40-03-53"><span>Other Symmetric Algorithms 03:40-03:53</span></a></h3><p>Some other symmetric algorithms you may come across are Blowfish, IDEA, CAST, and Twofish. While these algorithms aren&#39;t used much anymore, you should at least know they exist.</p><h3 id="asymmetric-encryption-03-53-05-23" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#asymmetric-encryption-03-53-05-23"><span>Asymmetric Encryption 03:53-05:23</span></a></h3><p>Asymmetric encryption makes use of two different keys, a public key and a private key. The public key is used to encrypt the data and the private key is used to decrypt it. Since these keys mirror each other, the private key only decrypts data that was encrypted with the matching public key. Let&#39;s see this in action.</p><p>Travis is sending his confidential file to Craig. To do that, Travis must first get Craig&#39;s public key. Travis then uses Craig&#39;s public key to encrypt the data, and the file is sent to Craig. When Craig gets the file, he uses his private key to decrypt it. As another example, asymmetric encryption is used in most communication over the internet.</p><p>For example, when you log on to a website, your browser sends a request for the public key which is then sent by the web server. Your login information is entered and encrypted using that public key, which is then sent to the server. The server in turn decrypts the login information using its private key. You&#39;re now logged into the web server. As you can see from these examples, users don&#39;t ever reveal their private keys in this exchange. Data security is increased with asymmetric encryption, which is the primary reason for using it.</p><p>Another reason for using asymmetric encryption is to create digital signatures.</p><p>A digital signature is a method used to ensure that a received message or document hasn&#39;t been modified from the time it was signed.</p><h3 id="digital-signatures-05-23-06-04" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#digital-signatures-05-23-06-04"><span>Digital Signatures 05:23-06:04</span></a></h3><p>This is done by generating a unique hash of the message or document and encrypting it with the sender&#39;s private key. When the recipient receives the message, they can verify the digital signature to ensure that the data or message is legitimate. Since anyone can decrypt these messages or documents with the public key, digital certificates don&#39;t secure data. They simply verify that the data is legitimate and came from the proper source. Guaranteeing the data source in this way provides non-repudiation, or the ability to ensure that the document&#39;s sender cannot deny sending the document.</p><p>There are four main asymmetric encryption algorithms you need to be aware of. These are Diffie-Hellman, RSA, DSA, and ECC.</p><h3 id="diffie-hellman-06-04-07-15" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#diffie-hellman-06-04-07-15"><span>Diffie-Hellman 06:04-07:15</span></a></h3><p>Diffie-Hellman was the first widely used asymmetric algorithm. It was released in 1976 by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman. This algorithm allows two parties who&#39;ve never met to safely create a shared key over a public channel, such as the internet. We can see how this key is created using a choice of colors.</p><p>For example, our two users each agree on a paint color such as yellow. Each user then decides on a secret color to mix with their common color, creating a color they can share publicly. They send each other their results and then mix in their secret color. Each user ends up with the same new secret color. This new secret color, or key, is then used to encrypt and decrypt their messages. If a hacker were to intercept any of these messages without knowing each user&#39;s secret color, they wouldn&#39;t be able to reverse the process and figure out the final secret color. Diffie-Hellman is frequently implemented in security protocols such as TLS, IPSec, SSH, and more.</p><h3 id="rivest-shamir-adleman-rsa-07-15-07-43" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#rivest-shamir-adleman-rsa-07-15-07-43"><span>Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) 07:15-07:43</span></a></h3><p>In 1977, Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman released one of the first public-key cryptosystems, which is known by the initial letters of the developer&#39;s surnames—&quot;RSA. RSA defined the process of using a public key to encrypt data and a secret key to decrypt it. RSA is still one of the most widely used algorithms for securing data transmissions and creating digital signatures.</p><h3 id="digital-signature-algorithm-dsa-07-43-08-01" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#digital-signature-algorithm-dsa-07-43-08-01"><span>Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) 07:43-08:01</span></a></h3><p>The Digital Signature Algorithm, or DSA, is a Federal Information Processing Standard for digital signatures. It was proposed in 1991 by NIST and became the government standard in 1993.

The algorithms used with this method can generate smaller keys that are just as secure as other methods. Many websites have adopted ECC to secure data being sent back and forth.</p><h3 id="hybrid-cryptosystems-08-19-09-24" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#hybrid-cryptosystems-08-19-09-24"><span>Hybrid Cryptosystems 08:19-09:24</span></a></h3><p>Asymmetric encryption methods aren&#39;t very efficient because they rely on some complicated mathematical computations. But they do make it easier to exchange keys. In contrast, Symmetric methods are efficient, but they become inconvenient when the time comes to get the keys out. A hybrid cryptosystem combines the efficiency of symmetric methods and the convenience of asymmetric methods.</p><p>Let&#39;s see how it works.</p><p>Travis needs to send a confidential file to Craig. Before doing so, Travis uses his symmetric private key to encrypt the data. Next, Travis encrypts the secret key using Craig&#39;s public key. The file is then sent to Craig. When Craig gets the message, he first uses his private key to decrypt the symmetric secret key and then uses the symmetric key to decrypt the message.</p><p>As long as Craig&#39;s private key is kept secret, the data is secure. Most secure communication methods such as TLS utilize a hybrid cryptosystem nowadays.</p><h3 id="ephemeral-keys-09-24-10-12" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ephemeral-keys-09-24-10-12"><span>Ephemeral Keys 09:24-10:12</span></a></h3><p>Generally, when we establish a session and exchange keys, all communication during that session uses the same encryption keys. These are known as static keys. The problem is that the longer a key is used, the more susceptible it is to attack. To combat this, we use ephemeral keys.</p><p>These are keys that are generated for each new session or transaction. Perfect forward secrecy makes use of ephemeral keys. Perfect forward secrecy and ephemeral keys are used quite often in instant messaging apps.</p><p>Every message that&#39;s sent generates its own encryption key. It doesn&#39;t matter if a hacker intercepts any of the keys because the next message has a completely different one. The hacker is unable to eavesdrop on the entire conversation or session.</p><h3 id="summary-10-12-10-47" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#summary-10-12-10-47"><span>Summary 10:12-10:47</span></a></h3><p>That&#39;s it for this lesson.

They have a sample document here on the screen for us that we can use.</p><p>To encrypt a document, I come up here to the encrypt/decrypt and I select modern algorithms. I&#39;m going to select RC4 algorithm, and in this case we can specify the length of the key that we want to include.</p><h3 id="short-keys-vs-long-keys-00-55-04-17" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#short-keys-vs-long-keys-00-55-04-17"><span>Short Keys vs. Long Keys 00:55-04:17</span></a></h3><p>I want to show you that shorter keys are very easy to crack, longer keys take substantial amount of time if they&#39;re long enough.</p><p>So, here we&#39;re going to select an 8-bit key length and I&#39;m going to specify my key. I&#39;ll just say AD and encrypt the document.</p><p>So, now we have the encrypted document and to decrypt it, if we already knew the key we could just come to this encrypt/decrypt option again, but since we want to discover what the key is, we&#39;ll come over here to analysis and come down to symmetric encryption and select the RC4 algorithm.</p><p>We&#39;ll go ahead and click start and it&#39;s already done. It&#39;s found possible key values and you can see the possible decrypted values up here. And of course this looks like something that we would expect and it says, hey, the key was AD. Go ahead and select that and it goes ahead and decrypts the document for us.</p><p>So, that was very, very quick. It didn&#39;t take any time at all. Let&#39;s go ahead and increase our key length and see what happens. So, we&#39;ll come down to RC4 and try instead a 16-bit key length. And we&#39;ll put in some numbers. And we&#39;ll encrypt.</p><p>And then we&#39;ll come over to analysis and do the same thing. Say 16-bit key length and start our analysis. And again, almost immediately, it comes back.</p><p>Let&#39;s go ahead and cancel out of that and let&#39;s increase our key length over here and see some that start taking a little bit of time.</p><p>Now, of course as processors get faster, you can do these things a lot easier. And in this case, it&#39;ll take just a couple seconds, but as we get to bigger, bigger key, it&#39;ll take substantially longer.</p><p>Comparing an RC4 24-bit, we&#39;re up to 10%. On my system, which is actually kind of beefy, looks like it&#39;s going to take about 30 seconds or so to complete. Let&#39;s go ahead and wait for that.</p><p>Okay, now that it&#39;s done it shows us the possible decryption values and sure enough, the key that it discovered for us does decrypt and shows the original document.</p><p>Let&#39;s go ahead and just show one more. Let&#39;s come up and instead of a 24-bit key, let&#39;s do a 32-bit key and put in some values. These are hex values of course. And then we&#39;ll come over and do our analysis.</p><p>In this case it looks like 32-bit on my machine will take about three hours to complete. Let&#39;s go ahead and just see what if we did a 56-bit key or higher.</p><p>Oops, we&#39;ll come back to the original document and I want to show you how this raises exponentially as you go on. So, let&#39;s do a 56-bit key, which is a reasonable length.</p><p>You wouldn&#39;t use that on the internet today, but in the early days, that was used and it was found to be too weak by brute force analysis, as you might see here.</p><p>So, let&#39;s go 56-bit. We&#39;ll go ahead and start. You can see we&#39;re in to a lot of years in order to brute force with a single computer. Now, of course we could cluster computers or use the cloud to decrypt these.</p><p>So many encryption algorithms are no longer considered secure, because you can do brute force analysis over many different computers. With enough computing power, you&#39;ve got to be careful on the length of your key.</p><p>I hope this shows you that the length of the key matters. You always want a longer key if you want your data more secure.</p><h3 id="summary-04-17-04-49" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#summary-04-17-04-49"><span>Summary 04:17-04:49</span></a></h3><p>So, in this demonstration we explored the relationship between key length and the time it takes for a brute force attack to decrypt a document. And there are great free tools to help us with that.</p><p>This is CrypTool version one, there&#39;s also a version two, which is more of a wizard type that allows you to take input, run it through different algorithms and see what the result would be.</p><p>So, I encourage you to check out both CrypTool and CrypTool version two.</p><h2 id="_7-1-5-symmetric-and-asymmetric-encryption-facts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_7-1-5-symmetric-and-asymmetric-encryption-facts"><span>7.1.5 Symmetric and Asymmetric Encryption Facts</span></a></h2><p>Encryption is the process of encoding data into something that is unreadable called ciphertext.

The cornerstone of cryptography is the algorithm, or cipher. Cipher is just a fancy word for the series of steps that are taken for data to be encrypted or decrypted. In this video, we&#39;re going to look at several types of ciphers and how they work.</p><h3 id="stream-cipher-00-23-00-46" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#stream-cipher-00-23-00-46"><span>Stream Cipher 00:23-00:46</span></a></h3><p>One of the first cipher types is the stream cipher. A stream cipher is a symmetric encryption method that encrypts 1 bit of plaintext at a time. This method is based on the one-time pad, or OTP, which was very popular during World War 2. OTP uses a symmetric encryption key that should be as long or even longer than the data being encrypted.</p><h3 id="one-time-pad-00-46-02-06" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#one-time-pad-00-46-02-06"><span>One-Time Pad 00:46-02:06</span></a></h3><p>For example, if you had a small message that was only 15 bits long, a random 15-bit key would need to be generated. That key can then be used to encrypt your message using a process called Exclusive-ORing, or XORing. XORing means that we compare two strings, our message and our random key, to generate an output. We do this by lining them both up. If the bits match, a 0 is generated. If they don&#39;t match, a 1 is generated. The output is our ciphertext!</p><p>What makes this so interesting is that this demonstrates perfect secrecy. This means that, to a hacker, this ciphertext looks completely random. It would be just as difficult to brute-force the key as it would be to brute-force the data itself.</p><p>OTP only works properly if our secret key is only used once. If we use it more than once, a hacker could then start to decode the secret key. OTP works great if we&#39;re dealing with small messages. But what if we needed to encrypt every video in this course?</p><p>A video can range from 500 megabytes to up to 5 gigs or more. Since every video file would need to generate a key that&#39;s the same size or larger than the video, we would quickly end up running out of hard drive space. So with today&#39;s data types, the one-time pad just isn&#39;t very practical.</p><h3 id="stream-ciphers-02-06-02-53" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#stream-ciphers-02-06-02-53"><span>Stream Ciphers 02:06-02:53</span></a></h3><p>Stream ciphers offer a solution to this problem.</p><p>A stream cipher can use a smaller fixed-length key that can be used repeatedly throughout the encryption process. This key is called a seed key, and in our example we&#39;ll say that it&#39;s 2048 bits. This key is run through a pseudorandom number generator which outputs a new and unique encryption key called a keystream. Notice that this new key matches the size of our data. The keystream is then XORed with the data to give us our ciphertext.</p><p>While stream ciphers are less secure than the one-time pad, the advantage to this method is that it can be used in real time. One of the most widely used stream ciphers was RC4. But due to multiple vulnerabilities discovered, it&#39;s no longer in use.</p><h3 id="block-ciphers-02-53-03-45" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#block-ciphers-02-53-03-45"><span>Block Ciphers 02:53-03:45</span></a></h3><p>Many symmetric encryption algorithms use the block cipher method. With block ciphers, instead of encrypting our data one bit at a time, the data is encrypted one chunk or block at a time. The common block sizes used are 64, 128, or 256 bits in length.</p><p>For example, let&#39;s say that we want to encrypt a file that&#39;s 800 bits in size. Using a 256-bit block size, the data will be encrypted 256 bits, or 32 bytes, at a time until the process is complete. Since the last block ends up being smaller than 256 bits, the algorithm pads the block with some random data to bring it up to 256 bits.</p><p>As shown here, there are several block cipher operation modes that can be utilized depending on the application or use. Let&#39;s talk about a few of them.</p><h3 id="electronic-code-book-ecb-03-45-04-12" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#electronic-code-book-ecb-03-45-04-12"><span>Electronic Code Book (ECB) 03:45-04:12</span></a></h3><p>Electronic Code Book Mode, or ECB, is the simplest block cipher operation mode.</p><p>With this mode, each block of plaintext data is encrypted separately. Several blocks can be encrypted at the same time, allowing for faster encryption. The biggest disadvantage is that identical data results in the same ciphertext, meaning that a hacker would be able to decipher some of the data if they intercept multiple blocks.</p><h3 id="cipher-block-chaining-cbc-04-12-04-41" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#cipher-block-chaining-cbc-04-12-04-41"><span>Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) 04:12-04:41</span></a></h3><p>Cipher Block Chaining is like ECB, except that it uses an initialization vector. The initialization vector is a starting variable that&#39;s XORed with the current block&#39;s plaintext to encrypt the data. The first initialization vector is a random string and each subsequent initialization vector is the ciphertext from the previous block. CBC is more secure than ECB but slower because multiple blocks can&#39;t be encrypted at the same time.</p><h3 id="cipher-feedback-mode-cfb-04-41-05-01" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#cipher-feedback-mode-cfb-04-41-05-01"><span>Cipher Feedback Mode (CFB) 04:41-05:01</span></a></h3><p>Cipher Feedback Mode, or CFB, also utilizes an initialization vector. But instead of using it on the plaintext, the initialization vector is encrypted and then that result is XORed with the plaintext to create the ciphertext block. This is the equivalent of encrypting the plaintext with a one-time pad.</p><h3 id="output-feedback-mode-ofb-05-01-05-30" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#output-feedback-mode-ofb-05-01-05-30"><span>Output Feedback Mode (OFB) 05:01-05:30</span></a></h3><p>Output Feedback Mode, or OFB, is practically identical to Cipher Feedback Mode. The difference is the initialization vector used after the first round of encryption. The CFB&#39;s output is XORed with the plaintext and the result is the next block&#39;s initialization vector. The process is the same in Output Feedback Mode, except that the encryption&#39;s output is the next block&#39;s initialization vector before it&#39;s XORed with the plaintext.</p><h3 id="counter-mode-05-30-06-08" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#counter-mode-05-30-06-08"><span>Counter Mode 05:30-06:08</span></a></h3><p>Next we have Counter Mode. Similar to ECB, every encryption process in Counter Mode is separate. Instead of using an initialization vector, Counter Mode uses a nonce combined with an encrypted counter. Nonce is simply a fancy word for a random string that&#39;s used for all blocks. The nonce&#39;s encrypted output and counter are then XORed with the plaintext to create the ciphertext. The counter starts at 0 and increments every block. By combining the nonce and counter, each block is using a different value so that even if the data is the same, the output will be different.</p><h3 id="galois-counter-mode-gcm-06-08-07-03" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#galois-counter-mode-gcm-06-08-07-03"><span>Galois Counter Mode (GCM) 06:08-07:03</span></a></h3><p>If we want to provide authentication with confidentiality, we can use the Galois Counter Mode, or GCM. This mode works just like Counter Mode. First, we have the counter and nonce encrypted. The output is XOR-ed with the plaintext to give us the ciphertext. Here&#39;s where things get different. The ciphertext is combined with a special hash. That output contains the ciphertext along with a message authentication code that gives us assurance that the data hasn&#39;t been tampered with. Because this method is efficient and provides authentication, we see it used often with network communications such as wireless networks and web servers that use SSH or TLS.</p><p>The other block cipher modes are classified as unauthenticated encryption and GCM is classified as authenticated encryption. There are some other encryption methods that authenticate, but the most common one is the Galois Counter Mode.</p><h3 id="lightweight-cryptography-07-03-07-47" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#lightweight-cryptography-07-03-07-47"><span>Lightweight Cryptography 07:03-07:47</span></a></h3><p>We&#39;re putting more and more Internet of Things, or IoT, devices into our networks; the need to encrypt data has never been more important.

Homomorphic encryption addresses this concern by allowing encrypted data to be used without decrypting it first. This is done by performing mathematical operations on the ciphertext instead of on the actual data itself. Homomorphic encryption works like other asymmetric encryption methods by using a public key to encrypt the data and a private key to decrypt it.</p><p>It helps to look at data as math problems to better understand the differences in the types of homomorphic encryption.</p><p>There are three types of homomorphic encryption: Partially homomorphic, which allows for only simple mathematical operations like addition and subtraction to be performed; somewhat homomorphic, which allows for more complex math such as multiplication to occur but only for a limited number of times; and fully homomorphic, which can handle any mathematical operation an unlimited number of times. Homomorphic Encryption has the potential to be a game changer, but as of now it&#39;s incredibly slow and inefficient.</p><h3 id="summary-08-53-09-23" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#summary-08-53-09-23"><span>Summary 08:53-09:23</span></a></h3><p>That&#39;s it for this lesson.

In this video, we discussed what a blockchain is and how it works. Then we looked at some implementations of blockchain technology.</p><h2 id="_7-1-9-blockchain-facts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_7-1-9-blockchain-facts"><span>7.1.9 Blockchain Facts</span></a></h2><p>This lesson covers the following topics:</p><ul><li>Blockchain</li><li>Blockchain implementations</li></ul><h3 id="blockchain" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#blockchain"><span>Blockchain</span></a></h3><p>Blockchain is a unique and increasingly popular implementation of cryptography. A blockchain is a decentralized and distributed ledger that records and verifies transactions between two parties. Blockchain uses cryptography to keep data secure. It was developed in 2008.</p><p>Each block is a transaction that is stored in a public database (the chain). A transaction can involve cryptocurrency, contracts, records, or other types of information. The first big use of the blockchain was the cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. The purpose of Bitcoin is to provide a method for people to make online transactions without the use of a centralized third party such as a bank.</p><p>Each block contains information about the transaction including:</p><ul><li> Time </li><li> Date </li><li> Parties involved </li><li> A unique hash that separates the block from other blocks on the chain </li></ul><p>Each block goes through the same process:</p><ol><li> User1 requests a transaction with User2. The request is made using User1&#39;s personal secret key and User2&#39;s public key. </li><li> The transaction is represented online as a block. </li><li> The block is distributed to everyone on a peer-to-peer network. </li><li> The network users verify the transaction is valid. </li><li> The block is added to the chain. This provides a indisputable and transparent record of the transaction. </li><li> The contents of the transaction move to User2. </li></ol><p>The entire transaction happens very quickly, usually within a matter of minutes. Every node contains a copy of the ledger. If a hacker changed a transaction, it wouldn’t matter because a copy of the transaction is stored on many other computers.</p><p>Each node plays an important part in the blockchain. Each node must prove itself by performing work before being allowed to join the network. This is typically done through mining.</p><p>Mining is the process of adding blocks to the chain. Each block has a 64-digit hexadecimal hash generated by extremely complex math computations. Generating the hash requires a lot of time and computing power. The process is split between each node. As a reward for performing these computations, the nodes are usually paid with cryptocurrency, like Bitcoin.</p><p>Even though each transaction is publicly visible, all personal information is encrypted and hidden from everyone, even the nodes. Because it’s a shared ledger and every transaction is publicly available, all persons involved can be held accountable for their actions.</p><h3 id="blockchain-implementations" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#blockchain-implementations"><span>Blockchain Implementations</span></a></h3><p>Sending money isn’t the only way blockchain can be used. Some large companies, including Microsoft and IBM, are working to adapt different technologies to the blockchain.

In this demo, we&#39;ll discuss how to hide the contents of a file inside another file using a technique called steganography. People have used steganography to send secret messages for hundreds of years. Typically, this method is used when the sender is concerned that their traffic is being inspected by a third party.</p><h3 id="use-openstego-00-26-00-39" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#use-openstego-00-26-00-39"><span>Use OpenStego 00:26-00:39</span></a></h3><p>We&#39;re going to use a free tool called OpenStego that&#39;s able to hide a file inside of an image. This tool is very easy to use and has a graphical user interface. We&#39;re going to run the tool on Linux, but it&#39;s also available on Windows.</p><h3 id="hide-data-00-39-01-39" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#hide-data-00-39-01-39"><span>Hide Data 00:39-01:39</span></a></h3><p>When we open up the tool, the first thing we see is the Hide Data screen; since this is the screen we want, let&#39;s move on to the fields that need to be filled out. Message File is the name of the file we want to hide in the Cover File, and it will be saved to the Output Stego File. I already have a file I want to hide, so I&#39;ll select that now. I&#39;ll come over here and navigate down until I find my file, secret-information.txt. Let&#39;s click OK.</p><p>Now that we&#39;ve selected the message file, we need to select the file we want to save the message into. I&#39;ve already downloaded a picture, so we&#39;ll select it and then continue. Once again, I&#39;ll navigate to my Pictures folder, where I&#39;ve stored the PNG we&#39;re going to use.</p><p>Lastly, we need to select where we would like to save the file that we&#39;ve encoded information into. Let&#39;s just call it secret-forest.png and save it in the same folder. I&#39;ll click over here and enter in &#39;secret-forest.png&#39;. We could enter a password here, but we&#39;ll just leave it for now. Since that&#39;s all the information we need, let&#39;s click Hide Data.</p><h3 id="compare-the-files-01-39-02-20" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#compare-the-files-01-39-02-20"><span>Compare the Files 01:39-02:20</span></a></h3><p>That&#39;s it! To see that it worked, let&#39;s check to see that the Secret Forest file has been created. I&#39;ll browse through my folders to get to the Pictures folder. This is the file we created that contains the hidden data. Let&#39;s take a look at the original file to see whether there are any major visual differences. This side-by-side comparison shows that, visually, the images appear to be identical. If we look at the file sizes, though, we can see a bit of a difference between the two. In the lower right-hand corner, you can see that the original image is 10 megabytes, and the file that we encoded data into is almost 12 megabytes. This kind of difference would be difficult to detect if you didn&#39;t know the size of the original file.</p><h3 id="extract-data-02-20-03-10" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#extract-data-02-20-03-10"><span>Extract Data 02:20-03:10</span></a></h3><p>Now that we see that the new file has been created, we should make sure that the data was stored properly. Let&#39;s try to extract the data. Let&#39;s go back to OpenStego and click on the Extract Data button. This page is a bit simpler, since the program only needs the new file and a folder to save the extracted file. I&#39;ll provide that data now and attempt to extract the data. I&#39;ll come over here and select my file. Click OK. Next, we&#39;ll just save it in the Pictures folder and select the Extract Data button. We&#39;ll wait for a second while it processes.</p><p>You can see that a text file was created in the folder. The file has the same name as the file we originally stored in the image, since the steganography tool saves that information in the image as well. We should make sure that the data inside the file is actually correct by opening it. I&#39;ll come up here and open the text file. And here&#39;s all our secret passwords.</p><h3 id="summary-03-10-03-21" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#summary-03-10-03-21"><span>Summary 03:10-03:21</span></a></h3><p>In this demo, we discussed steganography and methods for saving data to an image and extracting data from an image.</p><h2 id="_7-1-12-cryptographic-attacks" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_7-1-12-cryptographic-attacks"><span>7.1.12 Cryptographic Attacks</span></a></h2><h3 id="cryptographic-attacks-00-00-00-19" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#cryptographic-attacks-00-00-00-19"><span>Cryptographic Attacks 00:00-00:19</span></a></h3><p>No matter how many barriers we put in place to protect our data, hackers will always try to figure out a way to get around them and steal valuable information.</p><p>In this video, we&#39;re going to look at some common cryptographic attacks and what the future of cryptography might look like.</p><h3 id="cryptographic-attacks-00-19-00-38" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#cryptographic-attacks-00-19-00-38"><span>Cryptographic Attacks 00:19-00:38</span></a></h3><p>Encrypted data is usually secure, but there are no guarantees in the security world. By using new, targeted, or sophisticated attacks, hackers might be able to decrypt data you thought was safe. Some of the more common attacks are dictionary attacks, collision attacks, birthday attacks, and downgrade attacks.</p><h3 id="dictionary-attack-00-38-00-59" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dictionary-attack-00-38-00-59"><span>Dictionary Attack 00:38-00:59</span></a></h3><p>A dictionary attack is a type of brute force attack that is used quite often. In this attack, the hacker has a huge list of words and phrases that are used to guess a decryption key. These attacks work well against weak passwords, such as password123. Using longer and uncommon passphrases is the key to beating dictionary attacks.</p><h3 id="collision-attack-00-59-01-50" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#collision-attack-00-59-01-50"><span>Collision Attack 00:59-01:50</span></a></h3><p>Another type of attack is the collision attack. A collision attack tries to find two inputs that produce the same hash value. This type of attack is often used on digital signatures.</p><p>For example, we have a hacker that creates two different documents that have an identical hash value. With this type of attach, the hacker wants to get Travis to accept the second document by making it seem that it came from Craig.</p><p>The first document is sent to Craig, who agrees with what the document says, so he signs it and sends it back. The hacker then takes Craig&#39;s signature from that document, attaches it to a bad document, and sends that to Travis. Because the documents have the same hash, Travis&#39; software is unable to detect that there&#39;s anything wrong, and it looks totally legitimate. The problem with this attack is the difficulty of generating two documents that have the same hash.</p><h3 id="birthday-attack-01-50-02-21" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#birthday-attack-01-50-02-21"><span>Birthday Attack 01:50-02:21</span></a></h3><p>A birthday attack combines a collision attack and a brute force attack. This attack&#39;s name is taken from the birthday probability math problem.</p><p>If you have 30 people are in a room, the chance that someone has the same birthday as you is about 8 percent. But the probability that any two people in the room have the same birthday is 70 percent. This is because we&#39;re not looking for an exact match, just any match. This concept can be used to create two documents with the same hash, as in the collision attack example.</p><h3 id="downgrade-attack-02-21-03-23" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#downgrade-attack-02-21-03-23"><span>Downgrade Attack 02:21-03:23</span></a></h3><p>Another popular attack is the downgrade attack. These attacks are often used as part of the man-in-the-middle method. Downgrade attacks force the system to use an older, less secure protocol for communication.</p><p>A common example of this attack is SSL exploitation. Many servers have both SSL and TLS installed on them. If a client can&#39;t use TLS, then the server can revert to SSL. A hacker can set up their computer to only use SSL, which will then allow them to launch SSL-based attacks on the server.</p><p>Another common example is a man-in-the-middle attack. In this attack, the hacker intercepts the HTTPS packets and reverts them to HTTP packets. If the server isn&#39;t configured properly, it&#39;ll respond using HTTP, which allows the hacker to see everything being sent back and forth.</p><p>To combat these attacks, it&#39;s imperative that servers don&#39;t support older, less secure protocols. Proper server configuration is the key to stopping these types of attacks.</p><h3 id="quantum-cryptography-03-23-04-01" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#quantum-cryptography-03-23-04-01"><span>Quantum Cryptography 03:23-04:01</span></a></h3><p>Now let&#39;s look ahead to what&#39;s coming in the security world. The future of computers and cryptography lies in quantum computing.</p><p>Classic computing works by processing bits, or 0s and 1s. These bits represent the electrical signals of on and off. Quantum computing uses qubits, which can exist as both a 1 and 0 at the same time. Quantum computing is so much more powerful than today&#39;s computing.</p><p>This increased computing power means that today&#39;s encryption standards can be hacked easily and quickly. An encryption key that might take years to crack with today&#39;s computers can take days or even hours with quantum computers.</p><h3 id="post-quantum-cryptography-04-01-04-12" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#post-quantum-cryptography-04-01-04-12"><span>Post-Quantum Cryptography 04:01-04:12</span></a></h3><p>To combat the inevitable increase of quantum computing, researchers have already started work on post-quantum cryptography.

In this video, we covered different types of cryptographic attacks, including dictionary, collision, birthday, and downgrade attacks. Then we looked at the future of cryptography, which involves quantum computing and post-quantum cryptography.</p><h2 id="_7-1-13-cryptographic-attack-facts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_7-1-13-cryptographic-attack-facts"><span>7.1.13 Cryptographic Attack Facts</span></a></h2><p>Hackers attempt to figure out a way to get to data they want.
