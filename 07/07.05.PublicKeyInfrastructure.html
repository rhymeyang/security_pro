Because these keys are public, we need a way to manage and protect them.</p><p>Key management covers these keys&#39; whole life cycle. During this cycle, we must keep keys safe because we need to be sure that the public key we&#39;re using really does belong to the organization it&#39;s associated with. Public key infrastructure, or PKI, handles this for us.</p><p>A PKI provides an environment where public encryption keys can be created and managed. At the heart of a PKI are Certificate Authorities, which are responsible for issuing, validating, and revoking certificates. In this lesson, I&#39;ll go over the concept of Certificate Authorities, or CAs, and the process they use to verify a certificate with all of its different attributes.</p><h3 id="certificate-authorities-00-54-01-29" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#certificate-authorities-00-54-01-29"><span>Certificate Authorities 00:54-01:29</span></a></h3><p>A PKI relies on certificates that validate organizations. This creates a web of trust across the internet, allowing us to perform transactions confidently with websites around the globe. A PKI requires several elements to be effective.</p><p>The first element is the CA. CAs need to be reputable organizations that are respected enough to issue public certificates to organizations that want to communicate securely over the internet.</p><p>To increase security, CAs operate in a hierarchy of multiple CAs. This is done so that if one CA is compromised, only the certificates it issued need to be revalidated.</p><h3 id="root-ca-01-29-01-35" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#root-ca-01-29-01-35"><span>Root CA 01:29-01:35</span></a></h3><p>The first CA is the Root CA. This is a self-signed certificate that&#39;s used to validate additional CAs.</p><h3 id="intermediate-cas-01-35-01-56" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#intermediate-cas-01-35-01-56"><span>Intermediate CAs 01:35-01:56</span></a></h3><p>These Subordinate CAs are also known as Intermediate CAs. We can have multiple Intermediate CAs based on their policies and regulations. The Intermediate CAs validate the Issuing certificate authorities, and the Issuing CA is the one that hands out the certificates.</p><p>Now that we understand the certificate authorities&#39; hierarchy, let&#39;s look at how an organization can obtain their very own certificate.</p><h3 id="certificate-process-01-56-02-13" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#certificate-process-01-56-02-13"><span>Certificate Process 01:56-02:13</span></a></h3><p>To obtain a certificate, an organization needs to first send in a certificate signing request, or CSR, to a Certificate Authority. The CSR should contain the organization&#39;s public key, domain name, and digital signature. Then the CA verifies this information and issues the certificate.</p><h3 id="common-name-02-13-02-27" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#common-name-02-13-02-27"><span>Common Name 02:13-02:27</span></a></h3><p>When filling out the CSR, the organization provides their Common Name, or CN, which is more commonly referred to as the Fully Qualified Domain Name. For example, here you see that TestOut&#39;s Common Name would be www.testout.com.</p><h3 id="subject-alternative-name-san-02-27-02-49" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#subject-alternative-name-san-02-27-02-49"><span>Subject Alternative Name (SAN) 02:27-02:49</span></a></h3><p>The organization can also apply for a Subject Alternative Name, or SAN. This allows one certificate to apply to multiple host names. For example, TestOut could apply for a SAN that would cover site1.testout.com and site2.testout.com.</p><p>Once the CA has received the CSR, they verify the information and provide the certificate to the requesting organization.</p><h3 id="registration-authority-02-49-03-08" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#registration-authority-02-49-03-08"><span>Registration Authority 02:49-03:08</span></a></h3><p>Sometimes the CA relies on a third party to perform the validation. These third parties are called Registration Authorities. An RA is certified by a Root CA and is authorized to issue certificates for specific uses only. No matter who issues the certificates, each one has specific attributes for specific purposes.</p><h3 id="certificate-attributes-03-08-03-54" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#certificate-attributes-03-08-03-54"><span>Certificate Attributes 03:08-03:54</span></a></h3><p>Each CA&#39;s responsibility is to maintain a database that contains information on each certificate they&#39;ve issued. This information is mainly their certificates&#39; attributes.</p><p>These attributes contain everything from the serial number and signature algorithm to the public key and expiration date. CAs use the X.509 standard to define these attributes.</p><p>Each certificate has an expiration date. Before the certificate expires, the organization must revalidate the information and renew their certificate. If they don&#39;t, it&#39;s no longer valid.</p><p>Aside from expiration, there are other reasons a CA might invalidate or revoke a certificate. For example, if the organization is found to no longer exist, if the private key is compromised, or if the certificate was discovered to be fake, the CA should immediately revoke the certificate.</p><h3 id="certificate-revocation-list-crl-03-54-04-08" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#certificate-revocation-list-crl-03-54-04-08"><span>Certificate Revocation List (CRL) 03:54-04:08</span></a></h3><p>When a CA does revoke a certificate, it&#39;s added to a Certificate Revocation List, or CRL. This is a type of certificate blacklist. CAs maintain the CRL as part of their databases, and these should be updated quite often.</p><p>Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) 04:08-04:53 The X.509 standard also defines an internet protocol that can be used to determine a certificate&#39;s current state. This is called the Online Certificate Status Protocol, or OCSP.</p><p>The way OCSP works is your browser sends a status request to an OCSP responder and receives a response as to whether a certificate is valid or has been revoked.</p><p>Using the OCSP provides a few benefits. These include providing more timely information on a certificate&#39;s status, better bandwidth management because the client doesn&#39;t need to download the CRL, and a grace period for expired certificates.</p><p>If we follow the guidelines set in the X.509 standard, we can be assured that internet certificates are valid and have been checked appropriately by reputable Certificate Authorities.</p><h3 id="summary-04-53-05-16" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#summary-04-53-05-16"><span>Summary 04:53-05:16</span></a></h3><p>That&#39;s it for this lesson. In this lesson, we covered Certificate Authorities and the hierarchical structure they&#39;re set up in. We also looked at the process an organization goes through to request a certificate for themselves. Finally, we looked at some certificate attributes and how CAs use them to validate certificates or put them on a Certificate Revocation List.</p><h2 id="_7-5-2-public-key-infrastructure-facts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_7-5-2-public-key-infrastructure-facts"><span>7.5.2 Public Key Infrastructure Facts</span></a></h2><p>Asymmetric encryption methods, which use a public key to provide confidentiality and trust, are generally used to encrypt data transmitted over the internet. Proper management and safety of these keys is important. Public key infrastructure (PKI) provides an environment in which public encryption keys can be created and managed. At the heart of PKI are certificate authorities (CAs) who are responsible for issuing, validating, and revoking certificates.</p><p>This lesson covers the following topics:</p><ul><li>Certificate authorities.</li><li>Certificate process.</li><li>Certificate attributes.</li></ul><h3 id="certificate-authorities" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#certificate-authorities"><span>Certificate Authorities</span></a></h3><p>Certificate authorities are reputable organizations, responsible for issuing public certificates to other companies or organizations for secure communication over the internet. Certificate authorities are generally set up in a hierarchy of multiple CAs to increase security. This is also known as certificate chaining. CAs are usually set up as follows:</p><ul><li>The first CA created is the root CA. The root CA has a self-signed certificate which is used to validate additional subordinate CAs.</li><li>The subordinate CAs are known as intermediate CAs. These CAs validate issuing CAs.</li><li>Issuing CAs validate and distribute the certificates.</li></ul><p>The follow graphics depicts the CA hierarchy.</p><p><img src="/security_pro/images/07/ca_hierarchy.jpg" alt="CA Hierarchy"></p><p>This structure is commonly used to protect the root CA. If the root CA is ever compromised, all issued certificates must be replaced. By implementing certificate chaining, only certificates issued by the compromised CA need to be replaced.</p><h3 id="certificate-process" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#certificate-process"><span>Certificate Process</span></a></h3><p>For an organization to get a certificate, it submits a certificate signing request (CSR). This request generally includes the following information:</p><table><thead><tr><th class_="firstTableHeader" scope="col" class="fw-bold"> CSR Information </th><th scope="col" class="fw-bold">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Common name</td><td> The fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the website. <blockquote>Example: www.testout.com</blockquote></td></tr><tr><td> Subject alternative name <br> (SAN) </td><td> An optional field. The SAN allows the organization to have multiple host names covered in one certificate. <blockquote> Example: site1.testout.com and site2.testout.com </blockquote></td></tr><tr><td>Organization</td><td> The legal name of the organization. The name cannot be abbreviated and any suffixes, such as LLC, must be included. <blockquote>Example: TestOut Corporation</blockquote></td></tr><tr><td>Organizational unit</td><td> This is the division that is handling the certificate. <blockquote>Example: IT Department</blockquote></td></tr><tr><td>City/locality</td><td> City where the organization is located. <blockquote>Example: Pleasant Grove</blockquote></td></tr><tr><td>State/county/region</td><td> State where the organization is located.

The public key will be included here. </td></tr></tbody></table><p>Once the CSR has been submitted to the certificate authority, the certificate authority validates the information and issues the certificate.</p><p>Sometimes, the certificate authority may rely on a third party to perform the validation. These third parties are called registration authorities (RA). The RA is certified by a root certificate authority and is authorized to issue certificates for specific uses only.</p><h3 id="certificate-attributes" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#certificate-attributes"><span>Certificate Attributes</span></a></h3><p>Each CA has the responsibility of maintaining a database that contains the information, or attributes, of each certificate. The attributes that can be included are:</p><ul><li>Version - The X.509 version used for the certificate.</li><li>Serial Number - A unique identifier for each certificate.</li><li> Signature algorithm - The algorithm used to sign the certificate (SHA-2, RSA, etc.). </li><li>Issuer - The CA that issues the certificate.</li><li> Valid From and Valid To - The two fields that show the validity period of the certificate. </li><li> Subject - The field that contains the name and location information of the organization. </li><li> Public Key - The algorithm used to create the key and the public key information. </li></ul><p>Depending on the organization, there may also be additional optional fields called extensions in the certificate.</p><p>One of the key attributes is the Valid To field. If a certificate is not renewed by this date, it will expire and no longer be valid. Aside from expiration, some other reasons a certificate might be invalidated are:</p><ul><li>The organization no longer exists.</li><li>The private key has been compromised.</li><li>The issued certificate is discovered to be fake.</li></ul><p>If a certificate is invalidated for these or other reasons, it will be added to a certificate revocation list (CRL). The CRL is a blacklist of certificates. CAs must maintain and constantly update the CRLs as part of their databases. Web browsers automatically download updated CRLs at set intervals.</p><p>The X.509 standard also defines an internet protocol which can be used to determine the validity or state of a certificate. This is called the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP). OCSP can be used to simplify the process of checking whether or not a certificate is valid.</p><p>OCSP is designed to replace CRLs. Instead of a CA maintaining the CRL, an OCSP server called a responder maintains the lists of any revoked certificate. When the browser connects to a site, the browser sends a request to the OCSP responder to check the validity of the certificate. OCSP provides the following benefits:</p><ul><li>Timely information on the status of a certificate.</li><li> Better bandwidth management because the client does not download the entire CRL. </li><li>A grace period for expired certificates.</li></ul><h2 id="_7-5-3-certificate-types" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_7-5-3-certificate-types"><span>7.5.3 Certificate Types</span></a></h2><h3 id="certificate-types-00-00-00-27" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#certificate-types-00-00-00-27"><span>Certificate Types 00:00-00:27</span></a></h3><p>Depending on your purpose, there are different types of public key infrastructure certificates, or PKI certificates. These certificates are used to verify an organization&#39;s identity and ownership of the public key. In this lesson, I&#39;ll cover these types of certificates and how you can use them. I&#39;ll also go over some different validation levels used for SSL certificates.</p><h3 id="root-certificates-00-27-00-48" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#root-certificates-00-27-00-48"><span>Root Certificates 00:27-00:48</span></a></h3><p>A root certificate is the first certificate that a Certificate Authority, or CA, creates. This certificate is self-signed and is used to sign lower-level certificates, such as intermediate certificates. These certificates go through different processes to be approved, and the process depends on the certificate and organization.</p><p>Subject Alternative Name (SAN) Certificates 00:48-01:04 Subject Alternative Name certificates, or SAN certificates, allow an organization to cover multiple domains. For example, TestOut could cover testout.com, testout.net, or even labsim.com with the same certificate.</p><p>Wildcard certificates are like SAN certificates.</p><h3 id="wildcard-certificates-01-04-01-21" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#wildcard-certificates-01-04-01-21"><span>Wildcard Certificates 01:04-01:21</span></a></h3><p>Wildcard certificates allow an organization to cover unlimited subdomains. For example, TestOut could cover any site that ended in testout.com with the same wildcard certificate.</p><h3 id="code-signing-certificates-01-21-01-35" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#code-signing-certificates-01-21-01-35"><span>Code-Signing Certificates 01:21-01:35</span></a></h3><p>Code-signing certificates are used by app developers to prove that an application is legitimate and hasn&#39;t been altered or compromised. When the user installs a program and there&#39;s no certificate, they receive a warning that they shouldn&#39;t trust the app.</p><h3 id="self-signed-certificates-01-35-01-55" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#self-signed-certificates-01-35-01-55"><span>Self-Signed Certificates 01:35-01:55</span></a></h3><p>Self-signed certificates are certificates that haven&#39;t been validated and signed by a CA. These certificates are easy and free to make, but they don&#39;t provide the same protection and security as a CA-validated certificate. If a website uses a self-signed certificate, the user sees a warning when visiting the site.</p><h3 id="email-certificates-01-55-02-16" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#email-certificates-01-55-02-16"><span>Email Certificates 01:55-02:16</span></a></h3><p>Secure, encrypted emails are generally sent using the S/MIME Protocol. When you send secure emails, you need to know the recipient&#39;s public key, which you find in email certificates. These certificates are usually used within an organization that uses its own CA, but some public CAs also provide email certificates.</p><h3 id="user-and-computer-certificates-02-16-02-29" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#user-and-computer-certificates-02-16-02-29"><span>User and Computer Certificates 02:16-02:29</span></a></h3><p>You can use certificates to identify and validate individual users and computers. You generally see these kinds of certificates in a network environment where they&#39;re used to validate a computer or user to the server.</p><h3 id="validation-levels-02-29-03-52" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#validation-levels-02-29-03-52"><span>Validation Levels 02:29-03:52</span></a></h3><p>The most common use for certificates is for websites that use SSL or TLS. These certificates validate that the website is authentic and secure so that users feel safe.</p><p>When a site wants to purchase a certificate, there are three different validation levels a CA can offer. These are domain validation, organization validation, and extended validation.</p><p>Domain validation is the lowest level and isn&#39;t very secure. A CA issues a domain-validated certificate to anyone who&#39;s listed as the domain administrator in the WHOIS record. The CA usually validates this with a simple phone call or email, which isn&#39;t hard to spoof. These certificates can be issued usually within a matter of minutes.</p><p>An organization validation requires the certificate purchaser to not only prove that they&#39;re a domain administrator, but also that the organization is real. This process varies with each CA, but it&#39;s more in-depth than a domain validation. These certificates may take 1 to 3 days to be issued.</p><p>Extended validation is the highest level of trust. An extended validation requires the purchaser to prove that they&#39;re the domain administrator and also requires a much more thorough vetting of the organization itself. These certificates may take 1 to 5 days to be issued.</p><h3 id="summary-03-52-04-10" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#summary-03-52-04-10"><span>Summary 03:52-04:10</span></a></h3><p>That&#39;s it for this lesson.

These certificates go through a different validation process which varies depending on the certificate and organization. </li><li> Used to sign lower-level certificates such as intermediate certificates. </li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Subject Alternative Name (SAN)</td><td> SAN certificates allow an organization to cover multiple domains with one certificate. For example, TestOut could cover the following domains in a single SAN certificate: <ul><li>TestOut.com</li><li>TestOut.net</li><li>LabSim.com</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Wildcard Certificate</td><td> Wildcard certificates are similar to SAN certificates. But instead of covering multiple domains, the organization can cover one domain and multiple subdomains.

With domain validation: <ul><li> A CA issues a domain-validated certificate to anyone listed as an administrator on the WHOIS record. </li><li>Validation generally consists of a phone call or email.</li><li>Certificates are usually issued within minutes.</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Organization Validation</td><td> The organization validation is one step up from the domain validation. With organization validation: <ul><li> The purchaser needs to prove they are a domain administrator and also prove the organization is legitimate. </li><li> The validation process includes proving the organization is real and some basic information. But it is not as in depth as the extended validation. </li><li>These certificates can be issued in 1-3 days.</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Extended Validation</td><td> Extended validation is the highest level of validation offered by a CA. With extended validation: <ul><li> The purchaser needs to prove they are a domain administrator and the CA will also validate all information on the organization. </li><li> The CA will validate using a thorough and standardized identity verification process. This process includes proving: <ul><li>Exclusive rights to the domain</li><li> The organization&#39;s legal, physical, and operational existence </li><li> The organization has authorized the issuance of the certificate </li></ul></li><li>These certificate can take up to 5 days to be issued.</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="_7-5-5-manage-certificates" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_7-5-5-manage-certificates"><span>7.5.5 Manage Certificates</span></a></h2><h3 id="managing-certificates-00-00-01-50" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#managing-certificates-00-00-01-50"><span>Managing Certificates 00:00-01:50</span></a></h3><p>In this demonstration, we&#39;re going to practice managing the public key infrastructure.</p><p>To do this, we&#39;ll use the Windows Server 2019 system that already has Active Directory Certificate Services installed, which makes it a certificate authority, or CA.</p><p>It&#39;s called Active Directory Certificate Services because the CA itself is integrated with Active Directory to authenticate certificate requests.</p><p>We&#39;re going to practice requesting, approving, issuing, and revoking certificates on the CA. In order to manage the CA, we need to launch the CA console by clicking Tools and Certificate Authority.</p><p>We can see here the CA itself and the certificate categories: Revoke Certificates, Issue Certificates, Pending Requests, and Failed Requests.</p><p>By default, the CA is set to automatically approve any new certificate requests. However, we don&#39;t want that to happen.</p><p>Instead, we want to move the certificate request to a pending state, here in Pending Requests, until an administrator comes through and manually reviews the request. Then he or she either approves or denies it.</p><p>To make sure that this is set correctly, we&#39;re going to right-click on the CA, go to Properties, go to Policy Module, go to Properties again, and we can see that it&#39;s already currently set.</p><p>We set the certificate request status to Pending. The administrator must explicitly issue the certificate. That&#39;s exactly what we want. So, we&#39;re going to hit Cancel and then Cancel again.</p><p>Now if you actually did make any of those changes, you would start and stop the service for the certificate authority before they would be pushed through. You have to do that here: Start and Stop.</p><h3 id="request-a-certificate-01-50-03-20" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#request-a-certificate-01-50-03-20"><span>Request a Certificate 01:50-03:20</span></a></h3><p>With that setting checked, we want to request a new certificate now. There are two different ways to do this.</p><p>With the first method, I install the certificate authority and I also install the Certificate Enrollment Page. This allows users to request certificates using a web page running from the Internet Information Server Service on the CA itself.</p><p>Let&#39;s go ahead and open up Internet Explorer. We&#39;re going to point it to the right URL for the local host. There it is. It&#39;s going to be local host /certsrv. You see here the first task on the list is request a certificate.</p><p>Alright, we&#39;re going to come back to this window a little bit later. The second method is using the MMC console. Let&#39;s go ahead and right-click on the window. Go to Run, MMC, and hit Yes.</p><p>First, we&#39;re going to need to add some snap-ins. So, we&#39;re going to go Add or Remove Snap-in. We need the Certificate snap-in. Go to Add, My User Account, Finish, and Okay. The snap-in is here.</p><p>Now we can see all the different types of certificates that we can create for our current user. We&#39;re going to actually create one under Personal.</p><p>Go to Certificates, right-click, click All Tasks, and Request New Certificate. Go through Next, Next, Select User, Enroll, and Finish.</p><h3 id="approve-a-certificate-03-20-05-41" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#approve-a-certificate-03-20-05-41"><span>Approve a Certificate 03:20-05:41</span></a></h3><p>Now let&#39;s go back to our CA console. If we go into Pending Requests, we can see that it was properly sent straight to our Pending Requests. It wasn&#39;t actually issued.</p><p>So, you can see this certificate is the original certificate that was issued when we created our CA. Let&#39;s go back to Pending Requests.</p><p>From this screen, we can view the pending request and see the request ID here.</p><p>This is where we can now request whether we want to approve or deny this certificate. If we right-click it, we have the option to issue or deny. Let&#39;s go ahead and issue this certificate.</p><p>Now the certificate request is gone from Pending. If we go to Issued Certificates, we can now see It&#39;s been officially issued.</p><p>If I wanted to use this certificate, I could open up a web browser and access the enrollment web page on the CA. Then I would click View the status of this certificate request right here.</p><p>Because it&#39;s approved, I can actually download and use the certificate at this point. We can also verify this by going back to the MMC console. If we go to Active Directory User Object and then Certificates, we can see the certificate that was just issued to my user account. This one right here.</p><p>We can see all sorts of information here. For example, who it&#39;s issued to, who it was issued by, and the certificate authority, which is our certificate authority.</p><p>We see the certification expiration date here and its intended purpose. So, that&#39;s a personal certificate. It&#39;s intended for EFS encryptions, securing email, and client authentication. It was created using the user certificate template.</p><p>If we double-click the certificate, we can view the date range when it&#39;s valid and we can go to the Details tab. Here we can view additional details about the certificate. And if we click the Certificate Path tab, we can view the certificate path up to the root CA.</p><p>In this demonstration, we only have one CA and there are no subordinate CAs. So, the certificate path is actually really short. But in many organizations, you&#39;ll have one or more root CAs with subordinate CAs associated with it.</p><p>So, the Certificate Path tab can be used to view the path through the subordinate CAs up to the root CA. Let&#39;s close this and go back to our CA console.</p><h3 id="revoke-a-certificate-05-41-08-14" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#revoke-a-certificate-05-41-08-14"><span>Revoke a Certificate 05:41-08:14</span></a></h3><p>There may be different situations when the certificate shouldn&#39;t be used. For example, this is the case if the private key gets compromised in some way. In these situations, we should no longer use this certificate for encryption.</p><p>We would need to revoke it. To do this, we simply right-click the certificate, go to All Tasks, and to Revoke. You can specify a reason code for why this certificate is being revoked.</p><p>If you look, the last code is Certificate Hold. This is used in situations where you think there might be a problem with the certificate but you&#39;re not 100 percent sure.</p><p>We want to put the certificate on hold without fully revoking it so that we can verify whether or not it&#39;s an issue that would require it to be fully revoked or not. If there is no issue, we can take it off hold and continue using it. If there&#39;s a problem, we can fully revoke it.</p><p>If you were to use one of the other options here to revoke the certificate, such as Key Compromise, you couldn&#39;t unrevoke it. It&#39;s gone. You&#39;ll have to issue a new certificate. Let&#39;s go ahead and put it in Certificate Hold and hit Yes.</p><p>You see it clears out the Issued Certificates, and now it&#39;s on hold. Let&#39;s go to Revoke. You can see right here the revocation reason: Certificate Hold.</p><p>Because we just held it instead of revoking it all the way, we can unrevoke it. To do this, we right-click, go to All Tasks, and Unrevoke Certificate. Alright, it removed it.</p><p>If we go back to Issued Certificates, we can see the certificate is back for use again. Let&#39;s go ahead and do this again. But this time, go to All Tasks and revoke it for a different reason.</p><p>Let&#39;s go ahead and just say Key Compromise. Hit Yes. Alright, now it&#39;s revoked. If we go back to Revoked Certificates and we right-click, go to All Tasks, and try to unrevoke it, we can&#39;t.</p><p>We get this error: unrevoke command failed. Certificates can only be unrevoked if they&#39;re revoked with reason code Certificate Hold.</p><p>So, this certificate no longer can be used. You would have to reissue a new certificate in order for them to use it.</p><p>After you&#39;ve revoked a certificate, you need to let everyone know that the certificate has been revoked and shouldn&#39;t be used anymore. This is done by publishing the latest Certificate Revocation List.</p><p>To do this, we go to our Revoked Certificates folder, we right-click, go to All Tasks, and then click Publish. This will publish the latest list of revoked certificates to the Certificate Revocation List.</p><h3 id="certificate-revocation-list-08-14-09-24" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#certificate-revocation-list-08-14-09-24"><span>Certificate Revocation List 08:14-09:24</span></a></h3><p>There are two different types of Certificate Revocation Lists, or CRLs. You can publish a full CRL, which contains a list of all the revoked certificates. Or we can just publish a delta CRL which only contains the certificates that have been revoked since the last time the full CRL was published.</p><p>For our purposes, we&#39;re going to publish a new CRL because it&#39;s the first time we&#39;ve actually published a CRL from this CA. Let&#39;s go ahead and click Okay.</p><p>If you forget to do this manually, it&#39;s okay because the CA should be configured to automatically publish the CRL at a particular interval. If we right-click, hit Revoke Certificates again, and go to Properties this time, we can see the CRL publishing parameters.</p><p>By default, the full CRL is published once a week and the delta CRLs are published once a day.</p><p>If we click the View CRLs tab, then click CRL, and then click the revocation list, we can see the current CRL and the certificates that were just revoked. Because this CA hasn&#39;t been in use very long, there are not many certificates to be revoked. Let&#39;s go ahead and close it. Click OK and OK.</p><h3 id="authority-information-access-09-24-10-44" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#authority-information-access-09-24-10-44"><span>Authority Information Access 09:24-10:44</span></a></h3><p>Alright, now let&#39;s look at the properties of the CA. Let&#39;s right-click to Root CA and Properties. Alright, we&#39;re going to go to the Extensions tab. The Extensions tab has two acronyms that are very important to understand.</p><p>The first one is Authority Information Access, or AIA. The AIA allows end users to obtain the certificate used by the CA itself. This can be very useful if you have a root CA that is offline for security reasons.</p><p>This is not an uncommon configuration. Some organizations will keep their root CAs offline all the time to make them less susceptible to compromise. But we still need to have a copy of the root CA certificate.</p><p>To make this possible, we use AIA to publish a copy of the root CA certificate to some other location so that users can still access the root CA certificate. This is important because we need that root CA certificate with the CA&#39;s public key in order to verify digital signatures that the CA has implemented.</p><p>If the CA digitally signs something, you must have a copy of its public key to verify that signature. AIA makes that public key available offline. If we didn&#39;t do this and the root CA was offline, we&#39;d have to figure out some other way to get a copy of that key.</p><h3 id="crl-distribution-point-10-44-11-44" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#crl-distribution-point-10-44-11-44"><span>CRL Distribution Point 10:44-11:44</span></a></h3><p>In addition to AIA, we also have CRL and CRL Distribution Point, also known as CDP. This is where users go to get a copy of the latest CRL. The same issue exists here as exists with the root CA&#39;s public key.</p><p>If the root CA is offline, we can&#39;t access the CRL. We can&#39;t let everybody know which certificates have been revoked. What we can do is publish the CRL to some other location that clients can access.</p><p>For example, we can publish it to Active Directory via LDAP. We could access it on a web page, or we could put it in the file system.</p><p>Let&#39;s go ahead and click Cancel. If we go back to our Internet Explorer page, we can see there&#39;s an option to download the CA certificate or view the certificate chain or CRL.</p><p>This option, Download a CA certificate, is AIA. This one is CDP. If we click this option, we could download the latest CRL or the latest delta CRL.</p><h3 id="summary-11-44-12-15" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#summary-11-44-12-15"><span>Summary 11:44-12:15</span></a></h3><p>That&#39;s it for this demonstration. In this demo, we talked about managing certificates in the public key infrastructure. We looked at how you request a certificate and talked about using manual approval of certificates. We talked about how to issue certificates and about how to revoke certificates.</p><p>We ended this demonstration by talking about how to make the CA&#39;s public keys available via AIA and also how to publish the Certificate Revocation List.</p><h2 id="_7-5-7-extended-validation" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_7-5-7-extended-validation"><span>7.5.7 Extended Validation</span></a></h2><h3 id="extended-validation-00-00-00-54" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#extended-validation-00-00-00-54"><span>Extended Validation 00:00-00:54</span></a></h3><p>The most common reason for an organization to use certificates is to validate their websites that use SSL or TSL for security. Organizations go through the process of obtaining a certificate to prove that they&#39;re legitimate and trustworthy. The highest level of these certificates is the Extended Validation certificate.</p><p>Depending on the browser, you might notice a lock icon or green address bar when you visit a website that has an Extended Validation certificate. This is an easy way to identify that the site has been vetted and can be trusted.</p><p>An organization that has obtained one of these certificates has gone through a thorough vetting process by the issuing Certificate Authority, or CA, to prove that they&#39;re legitimate. In this lesson, I&#39;ll go over the different certificate formats and how they can be implemented.</p><h3 id="certificate-formats-00-54-01-18" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#certificate-formats-00-54-01-18"><span>Certificate Formats 00:54-01:18</span></a></h3><p>All Secure Sockets Layer, or SSL, certificates are X.509 certificates. This standard defines how certificates should be formatted. Some of the more common certificate encoding formats used by x.509 include Distinguished Encoding Rules, Privacy-Enhanced Mail, PKCS #7, and PKCS #12.</p><h3 id="distinguished-encoding-rules-01-18-01-51" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#distinguished-encoding-rules-01-18-01-51"><span>Distinguished Encoding Rules 01:18-01:51</span></a></h3><p>Let&#39;s first look at Distinguished Encoding Rules, or DER.</p><p>DER is one of the older formats. It&#39;s a set of rules that defines how data must be encoded in a file, and its parameters are defined by the Abstract Syntax Notation One interface, or ASN.1 interface, description language. DER is a binary, or non-text, encoding format that&#39;s mostly used in Windows systems. These certificates usually have a .der or .cer file extension.</p><h3 id="privacy-enhanced-mail-01-51-02-54" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#privacy-enhanced-mail-01-51-02-54"><span>Privacy-Enhanced Mail 01:51-02:54</span></a></h3><p>Next, we have the Privacy-Enhanced Mail format, or PEM format, which is the most common certificate format. PEM was originally created to securely encode emails, but it was quickly replaced with PGP and S/MIME. People soon realized, though, that the format was perfect for encoding certificates.</p><p>PEM certificates are a Base64 DER file. This means that the binary format is encoded to ASCII text so that you can see the actual characters. They won&#39;t make any sense to you, though, since everything&#39;s still encoded. The encoded data is sandwiched between a header and footer that identify what&#39;s in between them. For example, an encoded certificate would start with the words BEGIN CERTIFICATE and end with the words END CERTIFICATE.</p><p>A single PEM file can contain the intermediate, root certificates, and private key. The majority of CAs offer SSL certificates in PEM format with different file extensions. These could be .pem, .crt, .cer, or .key.</p><h3 id="public-key-cryptography-standards-02-54-04-10" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#public-key-cryptography-standards-02-54-04-10"><span>Public-Key Cryptography Standards 02:54-04:10</span></a></h3><p>Public-Key Cryptography Standards, or PKCS, is a group of standards published by RSA Security. These standards were published to promote the use of cryptography techniques, such as the RSA algorithm and several others. Two of these standards, #7 and #12, are used to format certificates.</p><p>PKCS #7 is also known as the Cryptographic Message syntax and is based on the PEM standard. Unlike the PEM format, these certificates can only hold the intermediate and root certificates. They&#39;re unable to hold the public key. Also, these certificates are generally used with digital signatures and have a file extension of .p7b or .p7c.</p><p>The PKCS #12 format is also known as the Personal Information Exchange syntax, or PFX syntax. Like the PEM format, these certificates hold the root, the intermediate certificates, and the private key. The biggest difference is that these certificates are password protected. You&#39;ll see them with the .pfx or .p12 file extension.</p><h3 id="summary-04-10-04-34" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#summary-04-10-04-34"><span>Summary 04:10-04:34</span></a></h3><p>That&#39;s it for this lesson.

Certificate Authorities, or CAs, are trusted organizations that validate and administer these certificates. In this lesson, I&#39;ll go over how CAs are set up and managed.</p><h3 id="certificate-chaining-00-24-00-41" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#certificate-chaining-00-24-00-41"><span>Certificate Chaining 00:24-00:41</span></a></h3><p>To fully understand how certificates work, you need to understand how CAs are set up. To increase security, CAs operate in a hierarchy of multiple CAs. This is done so that if one of the CAs is compromised, only the certificates it issued need to be revalidated.</p><h3 id="root-ca-00-41-00-49" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#root-ca-00-41-00-49"><span>Root CA 00:41-00:49</span></a></h3><p>The first CA is the Root CA.

You can have multiple Intermediate CAs based on their policies and regulations. The Intermediate CAs validate the Issuing Certificate Authorities and the Issuing CA is the one that hands out certificates. When you check the certification path in a web browser, you can usually see this structure.</p><p>For example, when we look at TestOut&#39;s certificate, we see that their server certificate was issued by this Intermediate CA, which was signed by this Root CA. This structure is known as certificate chaining, or the chain of trust.</p><p>Certificate chaining is done to protect the root certificate. If the root certificate is ever compromised, all certificates that have been issued underneath it are now invalid and need to be redone.</p><h3 id="online-vs-offline-ca-01-39-02-20" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#online-vs-offline-ca-01-39-02-20"><span>Online vs. Offline CA 01:39-02:20</span></a></h3><p>Another common method of protecting the Root CA is to keep it offline and only bring it online when it needs to authorize a new Intermediate CA.</p><p>Once the Root CA has been set up and the intermediate certificates issued, the Root CA is generally taken offline. This means that it&#39;s isolated from network access and is usually completely turned off. If an Intermediate CA is compromised, only the certificates they issued need to be reissued. In other words, not every certificate that was issued under the Root CA is compromised.</p><p>The problem with this is that the Root CA can&#39;t manage and update the Certificate Revocation List, or CRL, if it&#39;s offline.</p><h3 id="crl-management-02-20-02-46" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#crl-management-02-20-02-46"><span>CRL Management 02:20-02:46</span></a></h3><p>To remedy this, the Intermediate CAs can be set up to manage the CRL, or a specific Intermediate CA can be configured to handle this job.</p><p>Instead of having browsers constantly checking the CRLs, the Online Certificate Status Protocol, or OCSP, was created to replace CRLs and can be used to determine the validity of certificates. Let&#39;s see how this works.</p><h3 id="ocsp-02-46-03-01" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ocsp-02-46-03-01"><span>OCSP 02:46-03:01</span></a></h3><p>When OCSP servers, also called responders, receive a request from the web browser, they check with the CA and send an up-to-date certificate status. This frees up CAs from having to maintain their own CRLs.</p><h3 id="ocsp-stapling-03-01-03-37" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ocsp-stapling-03-01-03-37"><span>OCSP Stapling 03:01-03:37</span></a></h3><p>To further help with performance, a network might use OCSP stapling. Stapling simply means that the server that holds the certificate also provides any revocation information.</p><p>This works by having the certificate holder send a query to the OCSP responder at set intervals. Then the server staples that timestamped response to its certificate so that in the first SSL or TSL handshake the OCSP validation is already attached. Now, the user&#39;s browser doesn&#39;t need to perform a separate OCSP request.</p><h3 id="certificate-pinning-03-37-04-17" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#certificate-pinning-03-37-04-17"><span>Certificate Pinning 03:37-04:17</span></a></h3><p>Keep in mind that it&#39;s possible for a man-in-the-middle attack to intercept certificates during the handshake. This would allow a hacker to set up a malicious site using a valid certificate. This can be prevented using certificate pinning.</p><p>Certificate pinning is when an application, such as a web browser, has the server&#39;s certificate hard coded in the browser itself. When the application connects to the server, it downloads and checks the certificates. If they don&#39;t match, the application blocks the connection. Just know that certificate pinning was never really adopted by modern browsers, so it would mostly be used inside of an organization that&#39;s running their own CA.</p><h3 id="trust-models-04-17-04-37" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#trust-models-04-17-04-37"><span>Trust Models 04:17-04:37</span></a></h3><p>Let&#39;s shift gears to trust models. All CAs start with a single trust model. This means that there&#39;s one Root CA for the organization that issues and manages certificates. As you&#39;ve already seen, a hierarchical structure is mainly used. It starts with the root certificate and multiple Intermediate CAs below it.</p><h3 id="mesh-model-04-37-04-58" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#mesh-model-04-37-04-58"><span>Mesh Model 04:37-04:58</span></a></h3><p>It&#39;s also possible for you to set up a mesh model. In a mesh model, multiple CAs issue certificates to each other. This works great because if one CA is compromised, those certificates can still be valid because other CAs have authenticated them. The problem with this model is that it becomes extremely difficult to scale up with growth.</p><h3 id="bridge-model-04-58-05-36" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#bridge-model-04-58-05-36"><span>Bridge Model 04:58-05:36</span></a></h3><p>Another thing to consider is how trusts can be set up when one organization who has their own CA structure wants to partner with another organization that has their own CA structure. In this scenario, there needs to be a way for each organization to trust the certificates issued by the other&#39;s CAs. This can be done by setting up a bridge model in which both hierarchies trust each other. In this case, clients in both organizations trust certificates issued by CAs of either organization. You can also be more restrictive by setting up trusts with individual CAs that are lower on the hierarchy.</p><h3 id="web-of-trust-05-36-06-07" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#web-of-trust-05-36-06-07"><span>Web of Trust 05:36-06:07</span></a></h3><p>Another common setup is the web of trust. Instead of using a CA, everyone is a trusted authority.</p><p>For example, if Craig trusts Ethan and Lynette trusts Craig, Lynette will also have an indirect trust with Ethan. In other words, you trust a friend of a friend. We see this setup often in PGP.</p><p>Implementing the proper model can help ensure that certificates are properly maintained and validated. Of course, all of this also relies on keeping our encryption keys safe.</p><h3 id="key-safety-06-07-07-07" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#key-safety-06-07-07-07"><span>Key Safety 06:07-07:07</span></a></h3><p>Keeping a backup of private keys is important, but you&#39;ll need to make sure that they can&#39;t be accessed unless absolutely necessary. Normally, the CA never gets the user&#39;s private keys.</p><p>You can, though, use key archival to back up private keys. All this means is that the user sends their private key in a secure transmission to the CA to keep safe. The problem with this is that a serious security breach can occur if private keys are compromised. The advantage is that the archive of private keys is readily available if any are lost or corrupted.</p><p>Key escrow is like key archival, except that keys are sent to a trusted third party instead of the CA holding the keys. This is often done for security or legal purposes. Getting access to these keys may require legal action, and this is by design. For example, if law enforcement needs to access and analyze emails, they would need a court order to get the keys needed.</p><h3 id="summary-07-07-07-40" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#summary-07-07-07-40"><span>Summary 07:07-07:40</span></a></h3><p>That&#39;s it for this lesson. In this lesson, we discussed how CAs are set up to manage certificates. We first looked at the concept of certificate chaining, which is the method of using a hierarchical certificate structure. Then we covered the difference in online and offline CAs and the best practice of leaving them offline whenever possible. Finally, we discussed different trust models and how to assure key safety through key archival or escrow services.</p><h2 id="_7-5-10-certificate-concepts-facts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_7-5-10-certificate-concepts-facts"><span>7.5.10 Certificate Concepts Facts</span></a></h2><p>Using digital certificates to share public keys and validate organizations is a critical component of doing business over the internet. Certificate authorities (CAs) are the trusted organizations that validate and administer digital certificates.</p><p>This lesson covers the following topics:</p><ul><li> Certificate chaining </li><li> Certificate revocation list (CRL) management </li><li> Trust models </li><li> Private key safety </li></ul><h3 id="certificate-chaining" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#certificate-chaining"><span>Certificate Chaining</span></a></h3><p>Certificate authorities are generally setup in a hierarchy of multiple CAs to increase security.</p><ul><li> The first CA created is the root CA. The certificate is self-signed and is used to validate additional subordinate CAs. </li><li> The subordinate CAs are known as intermediate CAs. These CAs validate issuing CAs </li><li> Issuing CAs validate and distribute the certificates. </li></ul><p>This structure is known as certificate chaining or the Chain of Trust. It is commonly used to protect the root CA. For example, if the root CA is compromised, then all the certificates issued by that CA would need to be replaced. By implementing certificate chaining, if a CA is compromised, only the certificates issued by that CA would need to be replace.</p><p>Another common method of protecting the root CA is to bring it online only when it needs to authorize a new intermediate CA. Being offline means the root CA is isolated from all network access and is usually turned off.</p><h3 id="certificate-revocation-list-management" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#certificate-revocation-list-management"><span>Certificate Revocation List Management</span></a></h3><p>A certificate revocation list contains a list of digital certificates that have been revoked by the issuing certificate authority before their scheduled expiration date and should no longer be trusted. If the root CA is taken offline, it can no longer maintain the CRL.</p><p>The following table describes other methods that can be used to keep track of these revoked certificates:</p><table><thead><tr><th class_="firstTableHeader" scope="col" class="fw-bold"> CRL Management </th><th scope="col" class="fw-bold"> Description </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td> Intermediate CA </td><td> An organization can choose to setup and configure an intermediate CA whose sole purpose is to maintain and update the CRL. </td></tr><tr><td> Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) </td><td> The Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) is a protocol that web browsers can use to quickly check the status of a certificate. The purpose of OCSP is to replace the need for the CRL. OCSP is commonly implemented using: <ul><li> OCSP Stapling <ul><li> OCSP stapling can be used to help with performance.

The trust model you choose depends on the number of certificate authorities being implemented and their use. The following table explains each of these models:</p><table><thead><tr><th class_="firstTableHeader" scope="col" class="fw-bold"> Trust model </th><th scope="col" class="fw-bold"> Description </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td> Single trust model </td><td> All CAs start with a single trust model. This is the simplest model to setup. The single trust model has the following characteristics: <ul><li> There is only one CA that issues and distributes certificates. </li><li> All users trust the CA and there are no trusts established with other CAs. </li><li> This model works properly only in a small organization. </li><li> If the CA is compromised, all certificates must be replaced. </li></ul></td></tr><tr><td> Hierarchical model </td><td> A hierarchical model looks like a tree. <ul><li> The first CA created is the root CA. It is a self-signed certificate and is used to validate additional subordinate CAs. </li><li> The subordinate CAs are known as intermediate CAs. The intermediate CAs validate issuing CAs. </li><li> Issuing CAs validate and distribute the certificates. </li></ul></td></tr><tr><td> Mesh model </td><td> In the mesh model, multiple CAs are setup to issue certificates to each other. No CAs are configured in a subordinate relationship. <ul><li> If a CA is compromised, certificates can still be trusted because multiple CAs have authenticated them. </li><li> This model is difficult and expensive to expand on a large scale. </li></ul></td></tr><tr><td> Bridge model </td><td> The bridge model is a hybrid model that connects the hierarchical models of two organizations. <ul><li> Clients in both organizations will trust certificates issued by CAs of either organization. </li><li> Trusts can be setup further down the tree for deeper customization and security. </li></ul></td></tr><tr><td> Web of trust </td><td> A web of trust is typically used with Pretty Good Privacy encryption (PGP). Instead of implementing a CA, everyone is considered a trusted authority. For example, if User1 trusts User2 and User2 trusts User3, User1 will also trust User3. </td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="private-key-safety" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#private-key-safety"><span>Private Key Safety</span></a></h3><p>To ensure data can always be recovered, you should create a backup of the private keys. It is important to have a backup and equally important that the backup is kept safe. The following table shows two main methods to backup private keys:</p><table><thead><tr><th class_="firstTableHeader" scope="col" class="fw-bold"> Key Backup Method </th><th scope="col" class="fw-bold"> Description </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td> Key archival </td><td> In key archival, the key is backed up by the CA. To do this, the user sends the private key in a secure transmission to the CA to back it up. This method is often used in an organization that manages its own CA. <p> If keys are lost, they will be readily available and easily accessed. However, if the CA is breached, all private keys will be compromised. </p></td></tr><tr><td> Key escrow </td><td> Key escrow is a common method of key archival. With this method, keys are sent to a trusted 3rd party instead of a CA. This is often done for security and legal purposes. Legal action might be required to access the keys. This is done by design to ensure security and safety of the keys. </td></tr></tbody></table></div><!--[--><!--]--></div><footer class="vp-page-meta"><!----><div class="vp-meta-item git-info"><div class="vp-meta-item last-updated"><span class="meta-item-label">Last Updated: </span><!----></div><!----></div></footer><nav class="vp-page-nav" aria-label="page navigation"><a class="route-link auto-link prev" href="/security_pro/07/07.04.FileEncryption.html" aria-label="Section 7.4 File Encryption"><div class="hint"><span class="arrow left"></span> Prev</div><div class="link"><span>Section 7.4 File Encryption</span></div></a><!----></nav><!--[--><!--]--></main><!--]--></div><!--[--><!----><!--]--><!--]--></div>
