Social engineering is an attack involving human interaction to obtain information or access. </td></tr><tr><td> Footprinting </td><td> Footprinting uses social engineering to obtain as much information as possible about an organization. </td></tr><tr><td> Pretexting </td><td> Pretexting is a fictitious scenario to persuade someone to perform an action or give information. </td></tr><tr><td> Elicitation </td><td> Elicitation is a technique to extract information from a target without arousing suspicion. </td></tr><tr><td> Preloading </td><td> Preloading is influencing a target’s thoughts, opinions, and emotions before something happens. </td></tr><tr><td> SMiShing </td><td> SMiShing, or SMS phishing, is doing phishing through an SMS message. In other words, tricking a user to download a virus, Trojan horse, or malware onto a cell phone. </td></tr><tr><td> Impersonation </td><td> Impersonation is pretending to be somebody else and approaching a target to extract information. </td></tr><tr><td> SPIM </td><td> SPIM is similar to spam, but the malicious link is sent to the target over instant messaging instead of email. </td></tr><tr><td> Hoax </td><td> A hoax is a type of malicious email with some type of urgent or alarming message to deceive the target. </td></tr><tr><td> Hacktivist </td><td> A hacktivist is a hacker with a political motive. </td></tr><tr><td> Script kiddie </td><td> A less-skilled (usually younger) hacker that often relies on automated tools or scripts written by crackers to scan systems at random to find and exploit weaknesses. </td></tr><tr><td> White hat hacker </td><td> A white hat hacker is a professional who helps companies find the vulnerabilities in their security. Also known as an ethical hacker. </td></tr><tr><td> Cybercriminal </td><td> A person (or team of individuals) who use technology to steal sensitive information for a profit.

The attacker tries to trick their victim, convince them to do things, or make them give out information they wouldn&#39;t under normal circumstances.</p><p>Because this attack involves humans, it&#39;s very hard to protect your data and assets against social engineering. It&#39;s also much harder to track and catch it before any damage is done. The best way to minimize social engineer&#39;s impact is to educate employees, managers, administrators, custodial staff, clients, users, consumers--essentially, the entire planet should learn to recognize and respond appropriately to social engineering attacks.</p><h3 id="manipulation-and-motivation-00-42-01-46" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#manipulation-and-motivation-00-42-01-46"><span>Manipulation and Motivation 00:42-01:46</span></a></h3><p>Social engineers are master manipulators. They&#39;re very good at discerning signs and behaviors worth exploiting for information. Some of the tactics that exploit human weakness include moral obligation, innate human trust, threatening, asking for very little, and using ignorance.</p><p>If the attacker exploits the victim&#39;s willingness to be helpful and assist them out of a sense of responsibility, that&#39;s leveraging moral obligation.</p><p>If the attacker exploits the victim&#39;s natural tendency to trust others, they&#39;re taking advantage of innate human trust. The attacker wears certain clothes, creates a certain demeanor, and speaks words and terms the victim is familiar with so they&#39;ll trust the attacker and give them what they want.</p><p>A threat is when the attacker intimidates the victim by promising negative consequences if they don&#39;t comply with the attacker&#39;s request.</p><p>And attackers will often promise some reward in return for very little to nothing, asking the victim to do a small favor or share a bit of information in return for a huge payoff.</p><p>Ignorance means the victim isn&#39;t educated in social engineering tactics and prevention, so they can&#39;t recognize an attack even when it&#39;s happening to them.</p><h3 id="social-engineering-process-01-46-01-56" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#social-engineering-process-01-46-01-56"><span>Social Engineering Process 01:46-01:56</span></a></h3><p>Now let&#39;s talk about the steps involved in a social engineering attack. These steps can be divided into three main parts: research, development, and exploitation.</p><h3 id="research-phase-01-56-02-18" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#research-phase-01-56-02-18"><span>Research Phase 01:56-02:18</span></a></h3><p>The research phase is when the attacker starts gathering information about the company or organization they&#39;ll attack. Attackers use a process called footprinting to do this.</p><p>This is when the attacker goes through the target company&#39;s official websites and social media, performs dumpster diving, searches for employees&#39; names, email addresses, and IDs, goes on a company tour, and conducts other types of on-site observation.</p><h3 id="development-phase-02-18-02-56" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#development-phase-02-18-02-56"><span>Development Phase 02:18-02:56</span></a></h3><p>Then he&#39;ll move on to the development phase, which has two parts: selecting individual targets within the company being attacked and forming a relationship with the targets.</p><p>Usually, attackers choose people who not only have access to the information or object they desire, but show signs of being frustrated, over-confident, or arrogant, or having other traits that make it easy to extract information from them.</p><p>Once he&#39;s selected his targets, the attacker will start forming a relationship with them through conversations, emails, shared interests, and so on.

So, let&#39;s review the key things to remember about social engineers: skilled attackers will know which human weaknesses to exploit based on people&#39;s feelings, emotions, and personalities. They&#39;re also detail-oriented, patient observers. They&#39;re skilled manipulators and good at forming relationships. The best ones will even clean up their tracks to make sure they won&#39;t get caught even if the victim realizes what&#39;s happened some time later. And the best defense against social engineers is user education.</p><h2 id="_2-3-2-social-engineering-overview-facts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-3-2-social-engineering-overview-facts"><span>2.3.2 Social Engineering Overview Facts</span></a></h2><p>Social engineering refers to an attacker enticing or manipulating people to perform tasks or relay information. Social engineering tries to get a person to do something the person wouldn&#39;t do under normal circumstances.</p><p>This lesson covers the following topics:</p><ul><li>Manipulation tactics</li><li>Social engineering process</li></ul><h3 id="manipulation-tactics" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#manipulation-tactics"><span>Manipulation Tactics</span></a></h3><p>Social engineers are master manipulators. The following table describes some of the most popular tactics they use on targets.</p><table class="terms"><thead><tr><th class_="firstTableHeader" scope="col" class="fw-bold"> Manipulation Type </th><th scope="col" class="fw-bold"> Description </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td> Moral obligation </td><td> An attacker uses moral obligation and a sense of responsibility to exploit the target’s willingness to be helpful. </td></tr><tr><td> Innate human trust </td><td> Attackers often exploit a target’s natural tendency to trust others. The attacker wears the right clothes, has the right demeanor, and speaks words and terms the target is familiar with so that the target will comply with requests out of trust. </td></tr><tr><td> Threatening </td><td> An attacker may try to intimidate a target with threats to make the target comply with a request. This is especially the case when when moral obligation and innate human trust tactics are not effective. </td></tr><tr><td> Offering something for very little to nothing </td><td> Offering something for very little to nothing refers to an attacker promising huge rewards if the target is willing to do a very small favor. The small favor can include sharing what the target thinks is a very trivial piece of information for something the attacker offers. </td></tr><tr><td> Ignorance </td><td> Ignorance means the target is not educated in social engineering tactics and prevention, so the target doesn&#39;t recognize social engineering when it is happening. The attacker knows this and exploits the ignorance. </td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="social-engineering-process" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#social-engineering-process"><span>Social Engineering Process</span></a></h3><p>The social engineering process can be divided into three main phases: research, development, and exploitation. The following table describes each phase.</p><table class="terms"><thead><tr><th class_="firstTableHeader" scope="col" class="fw-bold"> Phase </th><th scope="col" class="fw-bold"> Description </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td> Research </td><td> In the research phase, the attacker gathers information about the target organization. Attackers use a process called <i class="fs-italicize"> footprinting </i> , which takes advantage of all resources available to gain information. Footprinting includes going through the target organization’s official websites and social media; performing dumpster diving; searching sources for employees’ names, email addresses, and IDs; going through a tour of the organization; and other kinds of onsite observation. <p> Research may provide information for <i class="fs-italicize"> pretexting </i> . Pretexting is using a fictitious scenario to persuade someone to perform an unauthorized action such as providing server names and login information. Pretexting usually requires the attacker to perform research to create a believable scenario. The more the attacker knows about the organization and the target, the more believable a scenario the attacker can come up with. </p></td></tr><tr><td> Development </td><td> The development phase involves two parts: selecting individual targets within the organization being attacked and forming a relationship with the selected targets. Usually, attackers select people who not only will have access to the desired information or object, but who also show signs of being frustrated, overconfident, arrogant, or somehow easy to extract information from. Once a target is selected, the attacker will start forming a relationship with the target through conversations, emails, shared interests, and so on. The relationship helps build the target&#39;s trust in the attacker, allowing the targets to be comfortable, relaxed, and more willing to help. </td></tr><tr><td> Exploitation </td><td> In the exploitation phase, the attacker takes advantage of the relationship with the target and uses the target to extract information, obtain access, or accomplish the attacker’s purposes in some way. Some examples include disclosing password and username; introducing the attacker to other personnel, thus providing social credibility for the attacker; inserting a USB flash drive with a malicious payload into a organization&#39;s computer; opening an infected email attachment; and exposing trade secrets in a discussion. <p> If the exploitation is successful, the only thing left to do is to wrap things up without raising suspicion. Most attackers tie up loose ends, such as erasing digital footprints and ensuring no items or information are left behind for the target to determine that an attack has taken place or identify the attacker. A well-planned and smooth exit strategy is the attacker&#39;s goal and final act in the exploitation phase. </p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="_2-3-3-social-engineering-motivation" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-3-3-social-engineering-motivation"><span>2.3.3 Social Engineering Motivation</span></a></h2><h3 id="social-engineering-motivation-00-00-00-15" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#social-engineering-motivation-00-00-00-15"><span>Social Engineering Motivation 00:00-00:15</span></a></h3><p>So far, we&#39;ve talked a lot about different social engineering techniques attackers use to reach specific targets. Now let&#39;s look at some techniques used when there isn&#39;t a specific victim the attacker wants to target.</p><h3 id="shoulder-surfing-and-eavesdropping-00-15-00-42" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#shoulder-surfing-and-eavesdropping-00-15-00-42"><span>Shoulder Surfing and Eavesdropping 00:15-00:42</span></a></h3><p>If the social engineer already has access to the target company&#39;s physical facility, then shoulder surfing and eavesdropping might be useful for stealing sensitive information and gaining access to data.</p><p>Shoulder surfing involves looking over someone&#39;s shoulder while they work on a computer to see usernames, passwords, or account numbers.</p><p>Eavesdropping is when an unauthorized person listens to conversations when employees or other authorized personnel are discussing sensitive topics.</p><h3 id="usb-and-keyloggers-00-42-01-22" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#usb-and-keyloggers-00-42-01-22"><span>USB and Keyloggers 00:42-01:22</span></a></h3><p>When on-site, the social engineer also has the ability to steal data through a USB flash drive. USB flash drives are incredibly useful, but from a security standpoint, they&#39;re risky devices. Imagine what could happen if sensitive information were copied to a flash drive, and then that drive was stolen or used to access sensitive data. By default, there are no access controls on the device, so anyone could potentially read its data.</p><p>An alternative to a USB is a keystroke logger, or keylogger. Social engineers often employ keyloggers to capture usernames and passwords. As the target logs in, the username and password are saved. Later, the attacker uses them to conduct the exploit.</p><h3 id="spam-and-spim-01-22-01-42" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#spam-and-spim-01-22-01-42"><span>Spam and Spim 01:22-01:42</span></a></h3><p>If the social engineer isn&#39;t on-site, a couple of techniques worth trying are Spam and Spim.</p><p>With spam, the attacker embeds a compromised URL in spam emails or banner ads that entice users to click them.</p><p>Spim is pretty much the same thing, but the malicious link is sent to the target over instant messaging instead of email.</p><h3 id="hoax-01-42-02-41" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#hoax-01-42-02-41"><span>Hoax 01:42-02:41</span></a></h3><p>Another email social engineering technique is called a hoax.</p><p>Here&#39;s an example. Let&#39;s say one of your co-workers comes to you in a panic, worried about some type of error, and it&#39;s obviously very alarming. It&#39;s meant to be; this hoax is designed to scare or intimidate users into thinking they&#39;ve contracted some type of virus. Normally, the email says something like, &quot;You&#39;ve contracted a Trojan horse!&quot; or some or kind of virus. It often includes a number you can call, and the person on the other end will take payment over the phone for fixing the virus, but they never actually do anything. There have been similar Windows Defenders hoaxes that use the same tactics.</p><p>But, as you know, viruses don&#39;t normally want to be discovered, so this is a dead giveaway. Unless you&#39;re being notified by a trusted anti-virus software that you or your administrator has installed, it&#39;s probably just a hoax.</p><p>A lot of email hoaxes are easy to spot because of their bad spelling and terrible grammar; but some hoax emails are quite sophisticated and use a variety of tactics to convince the target they&#39;re real.</p><h3 id="types-of-attackers-02-41-02-45" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#types-of-attackers-02-41-02-45"><span>Types of Attackers 02:41-02:45</span></a></h3><p>Now let&#39;s take a look at the different types of attackers you could encounter.</p><h3 id="insiders-02-45-04-16" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#insiders-02-45-04-16"><span>Insiders 02:45-04:16</span></a></h3><p>First, we&#39;ll talk about insiders. Insiders are one of the most dangerous types of threat actors. And often, they&#39;re the most overlooked.</p><p>Now, when we say insider, we could be talking about a customer, a janitor, or even a security guard. But most of the time, we&#39;re talking about an employee. And employees pose one of the biggest threats to any organization.</p><p>Don&#39;t get me wrong; I&#39;m not saying all employees are bad. However, you still need to look at them as potential threats and take the appropriate actions to prevent them from becoming actual threat actors and exploiting a vulnerability.</p><p>There are a lot of different reasons for an employee to become a threat actor. The employee could be disgruntled and motivated by a personal vendetta. Or they might want to make money--maybe they&#39;ve been bribed to steal information, or they could be working alone and decide to steal customer credit card information.</p><p>All of these motives require the employee to make a conscious effort to carry out an attack. But sometimes, an employee can become a threat actor without even realizing it. This is known as an unintentional threat actor. They create security breaches doing what they think is harmless day-to-day work. An unintentional threat actor is the most common insider threat.</p><p>See, because the unintentional threat actor has no idea they&#39;re doing anything wrong, they&#39;ll continue to compromise the organization in ignorance. This means that any employee has the potential to become an unintentional threat actor.</p><p>The key point to remember is that insiders typically have easier access to company information and assets than someone on the outside who&#39;s trying to break in, making them a much more dangerous threat.</p><h3 id="hackers-04-16-07-09" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#hackers-04-16-07-09"><span>Hackers 04:16-07:09</span></a></h3><p>The next threat agent is the hacker. Remember, the term hacker is kind of a broad, generic term applied to many different categories of threat agents. But generally speaking, a hacker is any threat agent who uses their technical knowledge to bypass security, exploit a vulnerability, and gain access to protected information.</p><p>There are a lot of different reasons why a hacker becomes a threat agent, but the most common reason is for attention. Instead of seeking financial gain or revenge, they just want the bragging rights--to be able to say, &quot;I did that!&quot;</p><p>They&#39;ll often hack just for the thrill of breaking in.</p><p>Some hackers just love knowing they can get past security measures and gain access to a system. They might not even do anything malicious after they get in.</p><p>Another reason is, of course, criminal. The hacker wants to gain access to your information to receive some type of reward. This reward could be financial, political, or something else entirely.</p><p>Hackers themselves come in a lot of different flavors--that is, their motives and labels are different. For example, some hackers call themselves hacktivists. These are hackers that have a political motive and are usually out to disrupt governments, large corporations, or other entities that oppose their political views.</p><p>Another is a script kiddie. Script kiddies aren&#39;t hackers in the traditional sense. As their name implies, they&#39;re sort of the kids of the hacking world. Script kiddies use applications or scripts written by much more talented people to attack systems or compromise devices.</p><p>The last type of hacker is known as a white hat hacker. A white hat hacker is a good guy who tries to help a company see the vulnerabilities that exist in their security.</p><p>One key attribute all hackers share is that they don&#39;t want to get caught. Because of this, they take extensive measures to cover up their tracks and make sure that the attack can&#39;t be traced back to them.</p><p>There&#39;s also a sub-category of hackers that could even be grouped with corporate spies. These are cybercriminals, and they have some unique traits that make them different from an average hacker.</p><p>Cybercriminals have unique motivations. Remember, hackers really don&#39;t want to get caught, and neither do cybercriminals. But cybercriminals are willing to take a lot more risks and use more extreme tactics because their motivation is usually a significant financial gain. They try to steal information that has value so they can sell it or use it.</p><p>For example, they could target banks to steal financial information or a hospital to steal personal information. In addition, they could be seeking revenge against a particular company or political entity. A lot of times, cybercriminals are associated with large organized crime syndicates, so might they might be trying to gain power in the world of organized crime by accumulating money, respect, or power.</p><p>The risk of being caught increases the longer an attack takes. The hackers we talked about before usually won&#39;t pursue an attack for very long. A cybercriminal, on the other hand, is willing to take more risks because the payoff is a lot higher.</p><h3 id="nation-states-07-09-08-38" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#nation-states-07-09-08-38"><span>Nation States 07:09-08:38</span></a></h3><p>The next attacker we need to look at is a nation state.</p><p>In today&#39;s world, you don&#39;t just need to deal with attacks from individuals or individual organizations—if you have really valuable information, you might have to deal with attacks from entire countries. And these are some of the most dangerous external attacks you&#39;ll face.</p><p>Why? Because attacks from nation states have several key components that make them especially powerful. First, nation state attacks are highly targeted. They identify a target and wage an all-out war. Second, they&#39;re extremely motivated. Third, they use the most sophisticated attack techniques of all the attackers. They often develop completely new applications and viruses in order to carry out an attack. And finally, they have a lot of resources and money at their disposal.</p><p>If a nation state sets its crosshairs on an organization, they&#39;re going to infiltrate it no matter what kind of security has been implemented. This is why it&#39;s so important to recognize what an attack looks like and what abnormal network traffic or behavior looks like. You need to be able to prevent attacks from occurring, but you also need to identify an attack that has already occurred.</p><p>One important thing to remember is that the average hacker is usually one person at home, trying to figure out ways to get into a system--and if things get too risky, they back off.</p><p>But cybercriminals and nation states may spend several years formulating an attack and conducting reconnaissance before executing an exploit, and they have a lot more resources and motivation.</p><h3 id="types-of-motivation-techniques-08-38-09-59" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#types-of-motivation-techniques-08-38-09-59"><span>Types of Motivation Techniques 08:38-09:59</span></a></h3><p>Just as there are different social engineering techniques and attackers, there are also different types of motivation techniques.</p><p>One very effective motivator is authority. It relies on power to get the victim to comply without question. The attacker pretends to be a superior high enough that the victim will comply with their requests right away. The attacker could also pretend to be acting as a superior&#39;s representative. This type of attack leverages fear. If an authority figure threatens a victim with their job or standing in the company, they&#39;re more likely to comply without a second thought.</p><p>Another type is social proof. This means the attacker uses social pressure to convince the victim that it&#39;s okay to share or do something. Most people are comfortable doing something if everyone else is doing it too.</p><p>Next, there&#39;s scarcity. This type appeals to the victim&#39;s greed. If something is in short supply and will sell out soon, the victim is more likely to fall for it.</p><p>There&#39;s also likeability. It works well because humans have a strong tendency to do more to please a person they like than a person they don&#39;t like.</p><p>Social engineers also use urgency to get what they want. The attacker will fabricate a scenario of distress to convince an individual that unusual actions are necessary.</p><p>The last method I&#39;ll mention in this video is common ground and shared interest. This motivator works because sharing a hobby, life experience, or problem instantly builds a connection and starts forming trust between two parties.</p><h3 id="summary-09-59-10-19" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#summary-09-59-10-19"><span>Summary 09:59-10:19</span></a></h3><p>That&#39;s it for this lesson.

But, of course, it&#39;s not really that simple because not all attackers are the same. They all have different motives, attributes, and attack characteristics, and they employ different techniques to get what they want from their targets.</p><p>For example, a single hacker trying to exploit a vulnerability is going to have a completely different attack profile than an organized crime group waging an assault on your network. It&#39;s your job to understand the different types of threats and attackers that exist so you can protect your systems.</p><h3 id="opportunistic-attack-00-38-01-35" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#opportunistic-attack-00-38-01-35"><span>Opportunistic Attack 00:38-01:35</span></a></h3><p>The first thing you need to be aware of is the difference between an opportunistic attack and a targeted attack. Let&#39;s start by looking at the less dangerous of the two, an opportunistic attack.</p><p>With an opportunistic attack, the attacker is almost always trying to make money as fast as possible with minimal effort. And because hiding your tracks and presence is very time-consuming, this type of attacker usually won&#39;t bother. They simply want to get in, grab the goods, and get out--think of it as the smash-and-grab of cyberattacks.</p><p>An opportunistic attack is typically automated and involves scanning a wide range of systems for known vulnerabilities, such as old software, exposed ports, poorly secured networks, and default configurations. When the scan finds a weakness, the attacker exploits the vulnerability, steals what they want, and gets out.</p><p>A common example of an opportunistic attack is ransomware. An attacker will gain access to a system, plant a virus that encrypts all user data, and demand payment for decrypting the data.</p><h3 id="targeted-attack-01-35-02-11" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#targeted-attack-01-35-02-11"><span>Targeted Attack 01:35-02:11</span></a></h3><p>A targeted attack, on the other hand, is much more dangerous. A targeted attack is extremely methodical and often carried out by multiple entities that have substantial resources.</p><p>This attack&#39;s main goal is to do damage--for example, leak sensitive information or destroy important data. Targeted attacks almost always use unknown exploits and go to great lengths to cover their tracks and hide their presence. They also use completely new programs written from the ground up that are specifically designed for the target.</p><p>In the case of social engineering, a targeted attack often involves elicitation.</p><h3 id="elicitation-02-11-02-25" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#elicitation-02-11-02-25"><span>Elicitation 02:11-02:25</span></a></h3><p>Elicitation is a technique used to extract information from a target without arousing suspicion.

Most human beings are proud of their accomplishments and love to be acknowledged. An attacker might pay the target a compliment on their work in hopes that the target will take the bait and elaborate on the subject. Even if the target downplays their skill or ability, talking about the project might give the attacker valuable information.</p><p>For example, let&#39;s say a business hires an attacker to spy on their competition&#39;s project plans. The attacker might either try to get a job inside the target company or befriend an employee who has access to the plans.</p><p>Whichever way the attacker goes about it, the goal is to get close to someone involved in the project—&quot;a peer or a superior--and compliment them on their contributions to entice them to elaborate on the project&#39;s details.</p><h3 id="misinformation-03-11-03-56" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#misinformation-03-11-03-56"><span>Misinformation 03:11-03:56</span></a></h3><p>Attackers might also engage a target by making a false statement on purpose. The attacker&#39;s hope, in this case, is that the target will correct them and give out the accurate details. The more precise the details the attacker gives, the better the chance that the target will take the bait and correct him.</p><p>For example, let&#39;s say an attacker wants to confirm how many security points a building has implemented. The attacker might befriend a security guard and, at some point, make a statement such as, Wow, I hear this building is a fort. It&#39;s impossible to get in. They have ten security cameras, six guards, and a fingerprint scanner. And that&#39;s just in the lobby!— By giving specific numbers and greatly exaggerating them, the attacker prompts the victim to correct him and state the accurate number of cameras and guards.</p><h3 id="feign-ignorance-03-56-04-39" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#feign-ignorance-03-56-04-39"><span>Feign Ignorance 03:56-04:39</span></a></h3><p>Feigning ignorance is another elicitation technique that&#39;s really useful. It&#39;s similar to what we just discussed about making a wrong statement. But instead of giving lots of exaggerated and specific details, this technique involves making a wrong statement and then admitting to not knowing much about the subject.</p><p>For example, an attacker could approach a victim and say, I don&#39;t know much about business, but I&#39;ve heard ABC company&#39;s product is way ahead of the product from XYZ company.— If the attacker knows the victim has some connection to the XYZ company, this statement will hopefully make the victim to not only correct the attacker, but also explain why the attacker is wrong in more detail. The explanation might help the attacker learn more, or at least have a chance to ask more questions without raising suspicion.</p><h3 id="be-a-good-listener-04-39-05-10" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#be-a-good-listener-04-39-05-10"><span>Be a Good Listener 04:39-05:10</span></a></h3><p>The last technique I&#39;ll mention is being a good listener. This may seem very basic, but it&#39;s incredibly effective. People are willing to share more when they feel safe, cared for, and connected to the listener. An attacker may approach a victim and carefully listen to what they have to say, validate their feelings, and even share similar experiences, real or fabricated. The point is to be relatable and sympathetic. As the victim feels more connected to the attacker, their barriers go down and trust builds, leading the victim to share more information than they would have otherwise.</p><h3 id="pretexting-preloading-and-impersonation-05-10-06-25" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#pretexting-preloading-and-impersonation-05-10-06-25"><span>Pretexting, Preloading, and Impersonation 05:10-06:25</span></a></h3><p>All the techniques mentioned so far involve some pretexting, preloading, and impersonation.</p><p>Pretexting is using a fictitious scenario to persuade someone to perform an action or share information they&#39;re not authorized to give out.</p><p>Pretexting is doing research and information-gathering to create convincing identities, stories, and scenarios tailored to specific targets. Preloading is influencing the target&#39;s thoughts, opinions, and emotions before something happens.</p><p>And impersonation is pretending to be trustworthy and approaching the target to ask them for sensitive information or convince them to grant access to protected systems.</p><p>For example, let&#39;s say an attacker comes into a building dressed in a technician&#39;s uniform. He has a badge, and he&#39;s carrying tools. He tells the front desk who called him and what he&#39;s there to fix. This attacker is simultaneously impersonating a legitimate technician and preloading his authority and legitimacy into the employee&#39;s mind. The employee is more likely to believe the attacker because there was no time for wondering about his presence or forming an opinion about his demeanor; these things were —œpreloaded— into the employee&#39;s mind. The pretexting part of this scenario was done prior to coming to the front desk by researching the authority figure&#39;s name to use as an explanation for being there and creating a convincing identity.</p><h3 id="interview-and-interrogation-06-25-08-19" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#interview-and-interrogation-06-25-08-19"><span>Interview and Interrogation 06:25-08:19</span></a></h3><p>Another technique social engineers often use is interviewing and interrogating.</p><p>When investigators interview and interrogate suspects and witnesses, they use several elements, such as environment and tone of voice, to help put the other person at ease. Obviously, an interview with an investigator isn&#39;t relaxing--that&#39;s just the nature of the situation--but the investigator wants to read the other party correctly by not adding more stress than is already present.</p><p>The same is true for social engineers. They use many of the same tactics to read their victims, but unlike a good investigator, they also use them to manipulate people.</p><p>Ideally, attackers start with an interview first, then lead naturally and gradually into an interrogation.</p><p>In the interview phase, the attacker lets the target do the talking while the attacker mostly listens. This way, the attacker has the chance to learn more about the target and how to extract information.</p><p>Also, in this type of conversation, the target leads while the attacker mostly clarifies the target&#39;s statements and listens with sympathy. There&#39;s no specific checklist of topics or questions for the attacker to hit at this point; the best thing to do is just let the conversation flow from topic to topic according to the target&#39;s desires. This is usually a very casual and comfortable setting for the target. It&#39;s mostly a get-to-know you type of situation. The hacker&#39;s intent is to become more familiar with the target and build trust between the two parties.</p><p>Then the attacker leads the interview phase into an interrogation phase. It&#39;s most effective if this transition is smooth and natural, after the target already feels a connection with the attacker and trusts him.</p><p>In the interrogation phase, the attacker talks to the target about their statements. At this point, the attacker is mostly leading the conversation with questions and statements that will flow in the direction the attacker has in mind to obtain the information he&#39;s looking for. The attacker may also reveal some sensitive information to prompt the target to share more in return. It&#39;s all about manipulating and exploiting the target.</p><h3 id="environment-08-19-09-07" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#environment-08-19-09-07"><span>Environment 08:19-09:07</span></a></h3><p>The environment the attacker chooses for conducting an interview and interrogation is essential to setting the mood. The location shouldn&#39;t be noisy or overly crowded. It&#39;s hard to get the target to keep going deeper into a subject without being distracted or becoming self-conscious if there&#39;s constant interruptions. Privacy is key to helping the target feel comfortable confiding in the attacker. It should be a stress-free and relaxing environment that puts the target at ease.</p><p>Seat arrangement is also important. Seats should be four to four-and-a half-feet apart and have a straight but comfortable back. The attacker shouldn&#39;t sit between the target and the door. The target should never feel trapped in any way. Lighting should be good enough for both parties to see each other clearly. This allows the attacker to read the target&#39;s micro-expressions and movements better. It also inspires the target to trust the attacker.</p><h3 id="observation-09-07-09-47" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#observation-09-07-09-47"><span>Observation 09:07-09:47</span></a></h3><p>During these interviews and interrogations, the hacker pays attention to every change the target displays to help discern their thoughts and the topics that should be investigated further. The attacker pays attention to body language, such as arm and leg position, touching the face or hair, whether the target becomes pale or flushed, mouth and eyebrow movements, posture, head position, eyes, voice pitch and intonation, and word choice.</p><p>Pretty much every part of the human body is a clue about what&#39;s going on inside the mind. Most people don&#39;t even realize they&#39;re giving out clues or recognize them in other peoples&#39; movements. But a skilled observer pays close attention and puts these clues together to discover thoughts and feelings.</p><h3 id="summary-09-47-10-17" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#summary-09-47-10-17"><span>Summary 09:47-10:17</span></a></h3><p>Okay, that&#39;s the end of this video, so let&#39;s review what we talked about. Social engineers are successful because their attacks are carefully crafted. They devote a lot of time and effort to developing and mastering their techniques. Each attacker is unique in their style and motivation. They might be opportunistic or tailor their attack to specific targets. They use techniques such as elicitation, pretexting, preloading, impersonation, interviews, and interrogation.</p><h2 id="_2-3-6-social-engineering-techniques-facts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-3-6-social-engineering-techniques-facts"><span>2.3.6 Social Engineering Techniques Facts</span></a></h2><p>Not all attackers are the same. They all have different motives, attributes, and attack characteristics.

Known vulnerabilities can include old software, exposed ports, poorly secured networks, and default configurations. When a vulnerability is found, the hacker will exploit the vulnerability, steal whatever is easy to obtain, and get out. This type of attack is typically used by a single hacker. </td></tr><tr><td> Targeted </td><td> A targeted attack is much more dangerous. A targeted attack is extremely methodical and is often carried out by multiple entities that have substantial resources. Targeted attacks almost always use unknown exploits, and the attackers go to great lengths to cover their tracks and hide their presence. Targeted attacks often use completely new programs that are specifically designed for the target. This attack type is typically used by an organized crime group. </td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="elicitation" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#elicitation"><span>Elicitation</span></a></h3><p>Elicitation is a technique used to extract information from a target without arousing suspicion.

The attacker’s intent is for the target to provide the accurate details that the attacker wants to confirm. The more precise the details given by the attacker, the better the chance that the target will take the bait. </td></tr><tr><td> Feigning ignorance </td><td> Attackers might make a wrong statement and then admit to not knowing much about the subject. The intent is to get the target to not only correct the attacker, but also explain in detail why the attacker is wrong. The explanation might help the attacker learn, or at least have a chance to ask questions without looking suspicious. </td></tr><tr><td> Being a good listener </td><td> An attacker may approach a target and carefully listen to what the target has to say, validate any feelings the target expresses, and share similar experiences, which may be real or fabricated.

In this way, the attacker has the chance to learn more about the target and how to best extract information. Then the attacker leads the interview phase into an interrogation phase. It’s most effective when done smoothly and naturally, and when the target feels a connection and trusts the attacker. In the interrogation phase, the attacker talks about the target&#39;s statements. The attacker is mostly leading the conversation with questions and statements that will flow in the direction the attacker needs to obtain information. </td></tr><tr><td> Environment </td><td> The environment the attacker chooses for conducting an interview and interrogation is essential to setting the mood. <ul><li> The location should not be overly noisy or overly crowded. </li><li> The environment should be a relaxing and stress-free setting that puts the target at ease. </li><li> The attacker shouldn’t sit between the target and the door.

This is when a social engineer masquerades as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication.</p><p>The attacker might send out a mass email that looks like it came from your bank, PayPal, Amazon, eBay, or the government. Attackers even copy graphics and text directly from the authentic site to make the email look completely legitimate.</p><p>The goal is to trick the recipient into revealing usernames, passwords, bank account numbers, credit card numbers, or some other sensitive information. The message will most likely say something like, &quot;We have reason to believe that we have your money, and we need to get it to you. Give us your contact information so we can return your money.&quot;</p><p>If you click on any links in the email, it brings up a page that looks like a legitimate web page for an actual organization. This page asks you to put in your username and password, your account number, or some other sensitive piece of information. When you hit Submit, the information goes to the person who sent the email, not to the institution. Unfortunately, this approach is very easy to execute and extremely successful.</p><p>Many recent large-scale security breaches directed at major retailers and government organizations were orchestrated using simple phishing emails that tricked employees into supplying the attacker with their username and password.</p><p>There are several variations of the phishing attack that you also need to be familiar with.</p><h3 id="spear-phishing-01-36-01-46" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#spear-phishing-01-36-01-46"><span>Spear Phishing 01:36-01:46</span></a></h3><p>In spear phishing, attackers gather information about the victim, like which online banks they use.

It involves the attacker executing malicious programs on the target&#39;s computer so that when the user enters any URL, it redirects traffic to the attacker&#39;s malicious website. This attack is sometimes called phishing without a lure. A pharming attack can be performed two ways: DNS cache poisoning and Host file modification.</p><h3 id="dns-cache-poisoning-02-43-03-03" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dns-cache-poisoning-02-43-03-03"><span>DNS Cache Poisoning 02:43-03:03</span></a></h3><p>In DNS cache poisoning, the attacker launches the attack on the chosen DNS server.

This attack is also called phishing without a lure. The attacker is then privy to the user’s sensitive data, like IDs, passwords, and banking details. Pharming attacks frequently come in the form of malware such as Trojan horses, worms, and similar programs. Pharming is commonly implemented using DNS cache poisoning or host file modification. <ul><li> In DNS cache poisoning, the attacker launches the attack on the chosen DNS server. Then, in the DNS table, the attacker changes the IP address of a legitimate website to a fake website. When the user enters a legitimate URL, the DNS redirects the user to the fake website controlled by the attacker. </li><li> In host file modification, the attacker sends malicious code as an email attachment. When the user opens the attachment, the malicious code executes and modifies the local hosts file on the user’s computer. When the user enters a legitimate URL in the browser, the compromised hosts file redirects the user to the fraudulent website controlled by the attacker. </li></ul></td></tr><tr><td> Social media </td><td> Many attackers are turning to applications such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, to steal identities and information. Also, many attackers use social media to scam users. These scams are designed to entice the user to click a link that brings up a malicious site the attacker controls. Usually, the site requests personal information and sensitive data, such as an email address or credit card number. </td></tr><tr><td> Typo squatting </td><td> Typo squatting, also called URL hijacking, relies on mistakes, such as typos made by users inputting a website address into a web browser. When a user enters an incorrect website address, the squatter may lead them to any URL. <br><br> The typo squatter&#39;s URL may be one of several types, but all are similar to the victim site address: <ul><li> Common misspelling of the intended site, such as symantic.com instead of symantec.com. </li><li> Misspelling based on a typographical error, such oreintaltrading.com instead of orientaltrading.com. </li><li> A plural of a singular domain name, such as viking.com instead of vikings.com. </li><li> A different top-level domain, such as tampicoil.org instead of tampicoil.com. </li><li> An abuse of the Country Code Top-Level Domain, such as cocoskeelingislands.com instead of cocoskeelingislands.com.au. </li></ul></td></tr><tr><td> Hybrid warfare </td><td> As it refers to technology, hybrid warfare employs political warfare and blends conventional warfare with cyberwarfare. Its goal is to influence others with things such as fake news, diplomacy, lawfare, and foreign electoral intervention. <p> Examples include: </p><ul><li> Meddling in elections </li><li> Misinformation </li><li> Meddling in the security of foreign countries </li></ul><p> In 2015, the US Department of Defense Cyber Strategy, developed five pillars to combat hybrid and cyber warfare: </p><ol><li> Build and maintain ready forces and capabilities to conduct cyberspace operations. </li><li> Defend the DoD information network, secure DoD data, and mitigate risks to DoD missions. </li><li> Be prepared to defend the U.S. homeland and U.S. vital interests from disruptive or destructive cyber attacks of significant consequence. </li><li> Build and maintain viable cyber options and plan to use those options to control conflict escalation and shape the conflict environment at all stages. </li><li> Build and maintain robust international alliances and partnerships to deter shared threats and increase international security and stability. </li></ol></td></tr><tr><td> Watering hole attack </td><td> The term &quot;watering hole attack&quot; is derived from predators in the natural world who wait for an opportunity to attack their prey near watering holes. A watering hole is a passive computer attack technique in which an attacker anticipates or observes the websites an organization uses often and infects them with malware. Members of the targeted group can then become infected. Hackers could be looking for specific information to narrow their attacks from users that come from a specific IP address. <p> A watering hole attack has five main steps: </p><ol><li> The attacker identifies the sites visited by a victim and then infects the sites with malicious code. </li><li> The attacker identifies the vulnerabilities with the sites and injects it with malicious code. This could be JavaScript or code into the ads and banners used on the website. </li><li> The malicious code redirects the victims to a phishing site where there is malware. </li><li> When the victims visit these websites, the script containing malware is automatically downloaded to the victim’s machines without their knowledge. </li><li> The malware then collects personal information from the victims and sends it back to the server operated by the attacker. </li></ol><p> There are several countermeasures against a watering hole attack: </p><ul><li> Update all your software to the latest versions and keep your operating system up to date. </li><li> Configure firewalls, intrusions detection and prevention, and other network security products. </li><li> Maintain your company&#39;s own website so it is free from malware. </li><li> Use a VPN and the private browsing feature web browser’s . </li><li> Be aware of the popular websites that employees visit and ensure that those sites are free from malware. </li><li> Train users on the dangers of potential watering hole attacks. </li></ul></td></tr><tr><td> Credential harvesting </td><td> Credential harvesting, also known as password harvesting, is the process of gathering the usernames, passwords, email addresses, and other information through breaches and other activities. Hackers can then sell personal and financial data on the dark web, use the information to gain access to a company network for illegal purposes. <p> Hackers might use cloned websites, such as Google, Amazon, eBay, and so on. When a user attempts to log in, they inadvertently send their credentials to the hackers. Hackers will also use phishing emails. Users must stay vigilant when receiving emails and be sure not to click on any unknown or unusual links. This could cause infected programs to download and install that you did not intend. </p><p> To prevent credential harvesting, users must update their security software and be aware of the links they click on and sites they visit. </p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="_2-3-9-use-the-social-engineer-toolkit" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-3-9-use-the-social-engineer-toolkit"><span>2.3.9 Use the Social Engineer Toolkit</span></a></h2><h3 id="use-the-social-engineer-toolkit-set-00-00-00-24" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#use-the-social-engineer-toolkit-set-00-00-00-24"><span>Use the Social Engineer Toolkit (SET) 00:00-00:24</span></a></h3><p>In this demo, we&#39;re going to talk about how to capture user credentials from a web page. While there are many different methods for gaining unauthorized access to a user&#39;s web account, we&#39;re going to do it by cloning a website&#39;s sign-in page and directing the user to enter the information on a fake page. To fool a user into going to our cloned sign-in page, we would create a phishing email and send it to them.</p><h3 id="choose-a-victim-00-24-01-15" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#choose-a-victim-00-24-01-15"><span>Choose a Victim 00:24-01:15</span></a></h3><p>But in this demo, we&#39;re just going to cover cloning. To do this, we will use one of the many exploits provided by the Social Engineering Toolkit. Because this is a demo, we&#39;re going to use a fake website. I&#39;ll enter the credentials myself to show how the tool works.</p><p>First, we need to find a website that we would like to attack, But since we&#39;ll only be cloning one page of the site, we need to know what the full URL is for the login page. Let&#39;s go to www.fakewebsite.com. This is a Wordpress site, which makes our life a little easier, since the login page name is almost always the same. To make sure, though, we&#39;ll click the login button on the page and see where it takes us. I&#39;ll scroll down here and click Log in.</p><p>Now that we&#39;re on the login page, we can look in the address field and see the full URL of the exact page we want to clone.</p><h3 id="clone-the-website-01-15-03-09" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#clone-the-website-01-15-03-09"><span>Clone the Website 01:15-03:09</span></a></h3><p>Since we&#39;ll need this URL later, we&#39;re going to copy it.</p><p>Now that we have the page we want to clone, let&#39;s open up the Social Engineering Toolkit. Since it&#39;s a command-line app, we&#39;ll be working in the terminal. Once the terminal opens, I&#39;ll type in &#39;setoolkit&#39; and press Enter. On this screen, you can see that there are two attack options, Social Engineering Attacks and Penetration Testing. If you add extra attacks made by others, they&#39;ll appear under Third Party Modules. The remaining options are for maintaining the Social Engineering Toolkit. The option that we&#39;re looking for can be found under Social Engineering Attacks. So, I&#39;ll select number 1 and press Enter. We&#39;re interested in cloning a website, so we&#39;ll select option 2, Website Attack Vectors. To get to the clone option from here, we&#39;ll select number 3, Credential Harvester Attack Method, and then number 2, Site Cloner. Since we&#39;ll be using this machine to host the cloned page and listen for credentials, we can leave the default options. I&#39;ll just press Enter to continue.</p><p>Next, we&#39;ll use Ctrl+Shift+V to paste the URL we copied earlier and press Enter again. Now the Social Engineering Toolkit is saying, &quot;Hey, do you understand what we&#39;re saying here?&quot; Yes, yes I do. It also offers a couple of troubleshooting instructions in case the tool isn&#39;t working. Since we expect it to work, we&#39;ll just press Enter to continue.</p><p>Now we&#39;re finally at the page that will show us if the tool sees anything interesting. Earlier, I set up a website with a name that&#39;s just a little different from the name of the website we&#39;re cloning. This is the page that you would send to someone to try to trick them into opening it. It&#39;s basically the same address, but with the number 1 at the end. Let&#39;s go to that page in our web browser. I&#39;m going to keep the terminal open on the side and open the web browser on the other side of the screen so you can see the tool working. I&#39;ll do that by opening Firefox and navigating to www.fakewebsite1.com.</p><h3 id="enter-credentials-on-the-cloned-website-03-09-04-07" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#enter-credentials-on-the-cloned-website-03-09-04-07"><span>Enter Credentials on the Cloned Website 03:09-04:07</span></a></h3><p>You can see that when I navigated to the cloned web page, something happened over to the right in the tool. It printed some information to the screen. This just shows that a connection request that was served to the requesting computer.</p><p>Now let&#39;s see what happens if I put in some user credentials. I&#39;ll type in &#39;admin&#39; for the user and &#39;letmein&#39; for the password. Press Enter to log in. And there we go. In the terminal, you can see some more information from the tool. Note that the tool tries to guess what information is important. This time, it correctly identified the password field, but didn&#39;t find a username field. That&#39;s because Wordpress username fields have kind of ambiguous names. But that didn&#39;t get in our way--this information was caught, as you can see right over here. It&#39;s worth noting that, after an attempted authentication, the Social Engineering Toolkit actually redirected us to the real website. This means that, typically, a user would likely just assume that they had entered their credentials incorrectly and try again. They probably wouldn&#39;t suspect a thing.</p><h3 id="summary-04-07-04-25" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#summary-04-07-04-25"><span>Summary 04:07-04:25</span></a></h3><p>And that&#39;s it for this demo. We discussed how to use the Site Cloner in the Social Engineering Toolkit, and we saw how you--or anyone--can clone a website&#39;s look and feel and trick users into entering their credentials on a fake website.</p><h2 id="_2-3-10-investigating-a-social-engineering-attack" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-3-10-investigating-a-social-engineering-attack"><span>2.3.10 Investigating a Social Engineering Attack</span></a></h2><h3 id="investigating-a-social-engineering-attack-00-00-00-16" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#investigating-a-social-engineering-attack-00-00-00-16"><span>Investigating a Social Engineering Attack 00:00-00:16</span></a></h3><p>In this demonstration, we&#39;ll talk about investigating a social engineering attack. We&#39;re going to focus on identifying the validity of emails, identifying the validity of websites, and identifying virus hoaxes.</p><h3 id="email-hoaxes-00-16-02-04" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#email-hoaxes-00-16-02-04"><span>Email Hoaxes 00:16-02:04</span></a></h3><p>Let&#39;s take a look at email validity. You should always be wary of emails from unknown organizations or senders. Be careful opening them, and be even more cautious with their attachments. A lot of hoax emails are pretty easy to spot because of their bad spelling and terrible grammar, but some of them look very, very real. Let&#39;s take a look at a couple of examples.</p><p>Let&#39;s start with this first one, Final Notice, Postal Status Notification. The first clue is the return address. It&#39;s from a variation of a Walmart address. It could be legit, but I&#39;m not so sure. Next is the logo. It has a logo with a question mark after the word Walmart. I&#39;ve never seen a Walmart logo like this, so I really wouldn&#39;t have to go any further to know it&#39;s a fake. If I hover over the logo, a bunch of addresses pop up. This looks like a batch of addresses that were spammed from this email. A little lower, when I hover over the Update Your Address Here link, I see a bunch more addresses. No legitimate email is going to be formatted to do this. Finally, here, it tells me to hurry, or I&#39;ll lose 17% of the money owed to me.</p><p>Let&#39;s look at this other one, the Check Your Account email. The address looks a bit odd. That&#39;s always the first clue. They want to confirm my information. I&#39;ve never heard of this company, and I don&#39;t gamble, so within a second, I know this is fake. These links down here are Bitl.ly, which is a URL shortening service. I don&#39;t think most legitimate emails would use a shortening service like this.</p><p>Then we have another email that I took a screenshot of. It&#39;s this Attention email that says it&#39;s from usafed.gov. This is someone posing as somebody from the US Treasury. They&#39;re using a Gmail address for communication, which the government wouldn&#39;t do. At the bottom of the email, they&#39;ve listed the legitimate website for the Department of the Treasury to make you think this is a legitimate email.</p><h3 id="header-information-02-04-03-02" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#header-information-02-04-03-02"><span>Header Information 02:04-03:02</span></a></h3><p>Another way you can verify an email is by taking a look at the header information. I have my Walmart email opened up in Outlook. This is another way to verify an email and its content. The header information is helpful because it shows IP information for the path an email took from its origin to the destination. It also shows other information, like the mail client that was used, the actual email address of the sender, and the originating IP address of the email.</p><p>There are a few ways to look at header information. In Outlook, it&#39;s helpful, but not easy to read. If we go into File &gt; Properties, you can see the header information right here. As you can tell, this can&#39;t be resized, and it&#39;s hard to read in this format. The mail client in Windows 10 doesn&#39;t have a way to view header information, but don&#39;t worry. You can view header information by opening the email in a text editor like I&#39;ve done with Notepad++.</p><h3 id="view-header-in-text-editor-03-02-03-20" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#view-header-in-text-editor-03-02-03-20"><span>View Header in Text Editor 03:02-03:20</span></a></h3><p>By looking through the email in this format, you can pick out many things about its origin and determine whether it&#39;s legitimate. Remember, this email was supposed to be from Walmart. Here&#39;s the sender&#39;s originating IP. If we highlight this address and copy it, we can actually look up some information on that IP address to see where it&#39;s coming from.</p><h3 id="ip-lookup-03-20-03-47" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ip-lookup-03-20-03-47"><span>IP Lookup 03:20-03:47</span></a></h3><p>All internet IP addresses for users come from some ISP somewhere. We can go to a website called arin.net, go to the search, and paste in our address. It&#39;ll find some information about this IP address. There are services that you can pay for that will give you a lot more information, but this one is free and simple. Looking at this information, I&#39;m very skeptical that this email came from Walmart because the mailing address for this IP is from France.</p><h3 id="website-validity-03-47-05-22" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#website-validity-03-47-05-22"><span>Website Validity 03:47-05:22</span></a></h3><p>Another thing we want to talk about is verifying websites. The first thing that you should always do is double-check the spelling of the website you&#39;re navigating to. If you&#39;re trying to go to PayPal and the address you end up at is paypals.com (with an s) or paypal.fakesight.com, then you&#39;re likely in the wrong place. You could accidentally give away your login information for PayPal (or a similar site) by entering it into a false site. You could also verify a site by viewing the SSL certification information. An SSL certificate (Secure Sockets Layer certificate) is a digital certificate that authenticates the identity of a website and encrypts the information sent to its server using SSL technology.</p><p>Let&#39;s look at two different browsers, Google Chrome and the Microsoft Edge browser. If we open both of these, there&#39;s a slight difference in how the SSL certificates are shown. In the Chrome browser, if you click on the lock in the address bar, it shows information about the certificate. I see that it&#39;s issued to google.com. I have a few tabs up here, Details and Certification Path. Under Certification Path, I see more information about the Certificate Authority and the certificate.</p><p>Now, if you go to Edge, open up Gmail, and click on the little lock, it&#39;ll show you the same information, but in a slightly different format. If there&#39;s no lock and no SSL certificate, you should be a little more cautious. Certificates aren&#39;t the focus of this lesson, but you want to make sure you know how to verify certificate information when you&#39;re not sure about a website.</p><h3 id="virus-hoaxes-05-22-06-08" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#virus-hoaxes-05-22-06-08"><span>Virus Hoaxes 05:22-06:08</span></a></h3><p>Our last topic is identifying virus hoaxes. You&#39;ve probably seen something like this before. Maybe one of your coworkers has come to you in a panic, worried about this type of error, and it&#39;s obviously very alarming. It&#39;s meant to be; this hoax is designed to scare or intimidate users into thinking they&#39;ve contracted some type of virus. Normally, it says it&#39;s something like a Trojan, as you can see here. Often, there&#39;s a number you can call where they&#39;ll take payment over the phone for fixing the virus, but they never actually do anything.</p><p>There have been similar hoaxes that use the same tactics, so it&#39;s good to understand that viruses don&#39;t usually want to be discovered. Unless you&#39;re being notified by a trusted antivirus software that you or your administrator has installed, then it&#39;s probably just a hoax.</p><h3 id="summary-06-08-06-31" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#summary-06-08-06-31"><span>Summary 06:08-06:31</span></a></h3><p>That&#39;s it for this lesson. We discussed verifying emails by looking at the HTML version and header information. We talked about verifying that a website is correct by checking the spelling of the address and the presence of a valid SSL certificate. We finished by discussing virus hoaxes.</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div><footer class="vp-page-meta"><!----><div class="vp-meta-item git-info"><div class="vp-meta-item last-updated"><span class="meta-item-label">Last Updated: </span><!----></div><!----></div></footer><nav class="vp-page-nav" aria-label="page navigation"><a class="route-link auto-link prev" href="/security_pro/02/02.02Malware.html" aria-label="Section 2.2 Malware"><div class="hint"><span class="arrow left"></span> Prev</div><div class="link"><span>Section 2.2 Malware</span></div></a><a class="route-link auto-link next" href="/security_pro/02/02.04VulnerabilityConcerns.html" aria-label="Section 2.4 Vulnerability Concerns"><div class="hint">Next <span class="arrow right"></span></div><div class="link"><span>Section 2.4 Vulnerability Concerns</span></div></a></nav><!--[--><!--]--></main><!--]--></div><!--[--><!----><!--]--><!--]--></div>
