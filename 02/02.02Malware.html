It often attempts to hide itself. And some malware even takes control of the computer system.</p><p>There&#39;s a long list of malware types. I&#39;m going to tell you about just a few of them.</p><p>Worm 00:21-00:45 First, let me introduce you to worms. A worm propagates without a file. It travels across computer networks without any user assistance, and it automatically replicates itself. Worms are one of the deadliest malware types because they can quickly spread to millions of computers. They usually take advantage of unpatched vulnerabilities in computer systems. To avoid a worm infection, keep your systems patched.</p><p>Trojan 00:45-01:45 Next, there&#39;s the Trojan. The Trojan virus is named after the Trojan horse in Greek mythology. It seems benign, but it&#39;s not. It usually comes in the form of a useful application hiding malicious code. It may be explicit or run invisibly. Trojans don&#39;t self-replicate like worms, and they aren&#39;t attached to a file like a virus. But they can create back doors for an attacker, allowing remote control of the infected machine.</p><p>The Remote Access Trojan, or RAT, is a common virus. A RAT is designed to give the attacker remote desktop access, including a GUI. It gives the hacker complete control over the system and allows them to view all communications, webcam footage, files, and emails.</p><p>Since a RAT requires the hacker to connect to the user through a port that isn&#39;t commonly used for internet access, if the user is behind a firewall, this often prevents the hacker from connecting. If the hacker can get around the firewall and open that port, then they&#39;re able connect.</p><p>Bot 01:45-02:23 Another well-known type of malware is the bot. A bot is a computer infected with a Trojan that allows software updates remotely. Bots commonly use IRC channels to communicate with the bot master, the hacker. When several computers get infected with the same Trojan, they&#39;re called a botnet. Botnets are under a command and control infrastructure of the bot master. They use botnets for spamming, committing click fraud, and performing distributed denial-of-service attacks. You can examine a system&#39;s firewall logs to determine if it&#39;s acting as a bot. In the log, you&#39;ll see traffic from the bot traveling out through the firewall.</p><p>Rootkits 02:23-02:44 Next, there are rootkits. This malicious software hides in the system and alters the system&#39;s processes and registry entries. A rootkit is almost invisible. It resides below antivirus software detection. This makes it difficult to detect and very dangerous. Special Anti-rootkit software can help detect rootkits.</p><p>Logic Bomb 02:44-03:16 Let&#39;s move on to the logic bomb. This is a piece of malicious code designed to execute only under pre-defined conditions. It&#39;ll lay dormant until the pre-defined condition is met, such as a certain time or date. Logic bombs can range from benign, such as pranks, to dangerous, such as driver formatters. One example is a piece of code that lies dormant until it executes once per year, perhaps on someone&#39;s birthday. Another example is a user opening a certain program that activates it, deleting the contents of disk drives.</p><p>Spyware 03:16-03:48 Next is spyware. This is computer software installed without the user&#39;s consent or knowledge. It&#39;s designed to intercept data or take partial control of the user&#39;s computer. Spyware often collects personal information about the user, like internet surfing habits and passwords. It uses tracking cookies to collect information about the user&#39;s activities and report it to the hacker. It can also interfere with a user&#39;s control in other ways, such as installing additional software, changing computer settings, and redirecting web browsers.</p><p>Crimeware 03:48-04:12 Our next category is crimeware. Crimeware is designed to a user&#39;s steal identity by accessing their online accounts and financial services companies, such as PayPal, banks, and online retailers. Hackers use the information gathered by crimeware to remove funds from those accounts or make unauthorized transactions. It often contains key loggers and other software to obtain passwords.</p><p>Ransomware and Crypto Malware 04:12-05:11 An important malware to know is ransomware. It allows a hacker to gain access to a system, plant a virus that encrypts all user data, and then demand a payment for decrypting the data. If the victim doesn&#39;t pay, the hacker threatens to destroy the data. But there&#39;s no guarantee that the hacker will actually send the decryption key once the victim&#39;s paid for it. There&#39;s also no guarantee that the victim will pay the ransom. If they have a backup still intact, they may choose not to pay.</p><p>Because of this, ransomware is becoming less prevalent and cryptomalware is gaining popularity. The difference between ransomware and cryptomalware is that crypto operates quietly in the background and keeps going indefinitely until it&#39;s noticed. This is called cryptomining. Mining cryptocurrency wears down a system substantially. It eats up bandwidth and processing power, which slows the system down and affects productivity. If it goes on long enough it can even cause graphic cards to die, processors to burn out, and memory to act unpredictably.</p><p>PUP 05:11-05:45 Next, we have PUP. A PUP, or Potentially Unwanted Program, is software that contains adware, installs toolbars, or has other unclear objectives. A PUP is different from malware because the user consents to downloading it. If a user downloads a program from the internet but forgets to read the download agreement, they may end up downloading additional unwanted programs. A few signs that you have PUPs on your computer include browser popups recommending fake updates or other software, web pages displaying improperly, and ads appearing where they shouldn&#39;t.</p><p>Fileless Virus 05:45-06:22 Another interesting malware is the fileless virus. It uses legitimate programs to infect a computer. Because it doesn&#39;t rely on files, it leaves no footprint, making it undetectable by most antivirus, whitelisting, and other traditional endpoint security solutions. Fileless malware isn&#39;t a traditional virus, but it works in a similar way by operating in memory. It never even touches the hard drive. Many hackers use social engineering to get users to click on a link in a phishing email. When the web page opens, the virus gets into the inner recesses of a trusted application such as PowerShell or Windows script host executables.</p><p>Prevent and Repair 06:22-07:24 Now let&#39;s talk about how you can prevent falling victim to malicious software. First, use the latest version and patch level for your web browser. Then install the latest patches for your operating system. You should also install antivirus, anti-spyware, anti-rootkit, and personal firewall software. On all anti-malware software, be sure to keep your definitions up to date for the latest threats. Use a pop-up blocker to prevent adware. Use software to control cookies on your system. Schedule regular scans to constantly detect malware.</p><p>If a scan does detect malware, quarantine or delete the malicious software. Malware may cause permanent damage to the system. Even though anti-malware software can scan, detect, and delete malware for you, the system may still need repairs. You might have to reinstall applications or even reinstall the entire operating system.</p><p>Many companies image their operating systems, so if malware is detected, they&#39;ll simply send down a brand new image that overrides the entire operating system.</p><p>Summary 07:24-07:41 All right, that&#39;s it for this lesson. In this video, we talked about different types of malware and how they work. We also learned how to prevent and repair malware in case your system or network becomes infected.</p><h2 id="_2-2-2-malware-facts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-2-2-malware-facts"><span>2.2.2 Malware Facts</span></a></h2><p>Malicious code, known as malware, is a type of software designed to take over or damage a computer without the user&#39;s knowledge or approval.</p><p>This lesson covers the following topics:</p><ul><li>Malware examples</li><li>Historic malware events</li></ul><h3 id="malware-examples" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#malware-examples"><span>Malware Examples</span></a></h3><p>Examples of common malware attacks are described in the following table.</p><table><thead><tr><th class_="firstTableHeader" scope="col" class="fw-bold"> Attack </th><th scope="col" class="fw-bold"> Characteristics </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td> Fileless virus </td><td> A <i class="fs-italicize"> fileless virus </i> uses legitimate programs to infect a computer.

The Trojan infiltrates the computer that runs the wrapper software. </li><li> Relies on user decisions and actions to spread. </li></ul></td></tr><tr><td> Zombie </td><td> A <i class="fs-italicize"> zombie </i> is a malware infected computer that allows remote software updates and control by a command and control center called a <i class="fs-italicize"> zombie master </i> . A zombie: <ul><li> Is also known as a <i class="fs-italicize"> bot </i> , short for robot. </li><li> Commonly uses Internet Relay Chat (IRC) channels, also known as <i class="fs-italicize"> chat rooms), </i> to communicate with the zombie master. </li><li> Is frequently used to aid spammers. </li><li> Is used to commit <i class="fs-italicize"> click fraud </i> . The internet uses a form of advertising called <i class="fs-italicize"> pay-per-click </i> , in which a developer of a website places clickable links for advertisers on the website. Each time the link is clicked, a charge is generated. Zombie computers can be used to commit click fraud by imitating a legitimate user clicking an ad. </li><li> Is used for performing denial-of-service attacks. </li></ul></td></tr><tr><td> Botnet </td><td> A <i class="fs-italicize"> botnet </i> refers to a group of zombie computers that are commanded from a central control infrastructure. A botnet: <ul><li> Operates under a command and control infrastructure where the zombie master (also known as the <i class="fs-italicize"> bot herder) </i> can send remote commands to order the bots to perform actions. </li><li> Is detected through the use of firewall logs to determine if a computer may be acting as a zombie participating in external attacks. </li></ul></td></tr><tr><td> Rootkit </td><td> A <i class="fs-italicize"> rootkit </i> is a set of programs that allows attackers to maintain permanent administrator-level, hidden access to a computer. A rootkit: <ul><li> Is almost invisible software. </li><li> Resides below regular antivirus software detection. </li><li> Requires administrator privileges to install and maintains those privileges to allow subsequent access. </li><li> Is not always malicious. </li><li> Often replaces operating system files with alternate versions that allow hidden access. </li></ul></td></tr><tr><td> Logic bomb </td><td> A <i class="fs-italicize"> logic bomb </i> is designed to execute only under predefined conditions. It lies dormant until the predefined condition is met. A logic bomb: <ul><li> Uses a trigger activity such as a specific date and time, the launching of a specific program, or the processing of a specific type of activity. </li><li> Does not self-replicate. </li><li> Is also known as an <i class="fs-italicize"> asynchronous </i> attack. </li></ul></td></tr><tr><td> Spyware </td><td><i class="fs-italicize"> Spyware </i> is software that is installed without the user&#39;s consent or knowledge. It is designed to intercept or take partial control over the user&#39;s interaction with the computer. Spyware: <ul><li> Is installed on a machine when the user visits a particular web page or runs a particular application. </li><li> Collects various types of personal information, such as internet surfing habits and passwords. It sends the information back to its originating source. </li><li> Uses tracking cookies to collect and report a user&#39;s activities. </li><li> Can interfere with user control of the computer such as installing additional software, changing computer settings, and redirecting web browser activity. </li></ul></td></tr><tr><td> Potentially unwanted program (PUP) </td><td><i class="fs-italicize"> PUP </i> is software that contains adware, installs toolbars, or has other unclear objectives. A PUP is different from malware because the user gives consent to download it. If you download a program from the internet but forget to read the download agreement, you may end up with unwanted programs being downloaded. A few signs that you have PUPs on your computer include browser popups recommending fake updates or other software; webpages you typically visit not displaying properly; and ads appearing where they shouldn’t. </td></tr><tr><td> Ransomware </td><td><em class="fs-italicize"> Ransomware </em> denies access to a computer system until the user pays a ransom. </td></tr><tr><td> Scareware </td><td><em class="fs-italicize"> Scareware </em> is a scam to fool users into thinking they have some form of malware on their system. The intent of the scam is to sell the user fake antivirus software to remove malware they don&#39;t have. </td></tr><tr><td> Crimeware </td><td><i class="fs-italicize"> Crimeware </i> is designed to perpetrate identity theft to allow access to online accounts at financial services, such as banks and online retailers. Crimeware can: <ul><li> Use keystroke loggers to capture keystrokes, mouse operations, or screenshots and transmit those actions back to the attacker to obtain passwords. </li><li> Redirect users to fake sites. </li><li> Steal cached passwords. </li><li> Conduct transactions in the background after logon. </li></ul></td></tr><tr><td> Crypto-malware </td><td><i class="fs-italicize"> Crypto-malware </i> is ransomware that encrypts files until a ransom is paid. </td></tr><tr><td> Remote Access Trojan (RAT) </td><td> A RAT is a malware program that includes a back door that allows administrative control over the target computer. RATs are usually downloaded invisibly with a user-requested program, such as a game or an email attachment. A RAT can: <ul><li> Use keystroke loggers that capture keystrokes, mouse operations, or screenshots, and transmits those actions back to the attacker to obtain passwords. </li><li> Access confidential information, like credit card and social security numbers. </li><li> Format drives. </li><li> Activate a system&#39;s webcam and record video. </li><li> Delete, download, or alter files and file systems. </li><li> Distribute viruses and other malware. </li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="historic-malware-events" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#historic-malware-events"><span>Historic Malware Events</span></a></h3><p>The amount of computer malware has increased exponentially over time and the nature of malware has grown increasingly malignant and powerful. You should be familiar with the following historic malware events:</p><table><thead><tr><th class_="firstTableHeader" scope="col" class="fw-bold"> Malicious Act </th><td> Description </td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td> Stoned </td><td> The 1987 Stoned virus was one of the first viruses. It was very common and widespread in the early 1990s. The virus infects the master boot record of a hard drive and floppy disks. </td></tr><tr><td> Michelangelo </td><td> The 1991 Michelangelo virus was designed to infect MS-DOS systems and remain dormant until March 6, the birthday of Renaissance artist Michelangelo. The virus infects the master boot record of a hard drive. Once a system becomes infected, any floppy disk inserted into the system becomes immediately infected, as well. </td></tr><tr><td> CIH/Chernobyl Virus </td><td> The 1999 Chernobyl virus was the first computer virus that affected computer hardware. It infected executable files, then spread after the file was executed. After it was initiated, CIH would continue until the entire hard drive was erased. Then it would overwrite the system BIOS, causing machines to crash. </td></tr><tr><td> Melissa </td><td> The 1999 Melissa worm was the first widely distributed macro virus that was propagated in the form of an email message containing an infected Word document as an attachment. </td></tr><tr><td> ILOVEYOU </td><td> The 2000 ILOVEYOU worm was propagated in the form of an email message containing an infected VBScript (Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting) attachment. When executed, the VBScript would alter the registry keys to allow the malware to start up at every boot. It would also search for and replace *.jpg, *.jpeg, *.vbs, *.vbe, *.js, *.jse, *.css, *.wsh, *.sct, *.doc, and *.hta files with copies of itself while appending the file name with a .vbs extension. </td></tr><tr><td> Code Red </td><td> The 2001 Code Red worm was designed to attack and exploit vulnerabilities within Microsoft Web IIS servers. It replicated from port to port with remarkable speed, infecting over 250,000 systems in under 9 hours. </td></tr><tr><td> Nimda </td><td> The 2001 Nimda worm took advantage of weaknesses found in the Windows platform and propagated itself in several ways, including email, infected websites, and network shares. It also left multiple back doors to allow for additional attacks. </td></tr><tr><td> Klez </td><td> The 2001-2002 Klez worm propagated through email. It infected executables by creating a hidden copy of the original host file and then overwriting the original file with itself. It attacked unpatched versions of Outlook and Outlook Express to allow attackers to control the system. </td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="_2-2-3-malware-protection-facts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-2-3-malware-protection-facts"><span>2.2.3 Malware Protection Facts</span></a></h2><p>Malware is software designed to infiltrate or damage a computer system without the owner’s consent or knowledge.

Spyware, adware, crimeware, and Trojans all take advantage of downloads.</li><li>Remove removable drives to prevent unauthorized software from being installed on a system.</li><li>Show full file extensions on all files. Viruses, worms, and Trojans often make use of double file extensions to change files that are normally deemed harmless. For example, adding the extension .TXT.EXE to a file will make the file appear as a text file in an attachment when, in reality, it is an executable.</li><li>Enable antivirus scanning for all email attachments.</li><li>Enable antivirus scanning for all removable storage, such as USB flash drives and CD-ROMs.</li><li>Block executable files that have been copied from another computer.

Recovery from malware can include the following steps:</p><ul><li>You may have to reinstall applications, features, or even the entire operating system from scratch.</li><li>If your organization uses imaging solutions, you can quickly re-image a machine if it is infected with malware. Re-imaging or installing from scratch is often faster and more effective than malware removal and cleanup.</li><li><strong>Remediation</strong> is the process of correcting problems. Most antivirus software remediates problems automatically or semi-automatically by prompting you to identify the action to take. Possible actions in response to problems are: <ul><li>Repair the infection. Repair is possible for true viruses that have attached themselves to valid files. During the repair, the virus is removed and the file is placed back in its original state, if possible.</li><li>Quarantine the file. Quarantine moves the infected file to a secure folder where it cannot open or run normally. You might quarantine an infected file that cannot be repaired to see if another tool or utility might be able to recover the file at another time.</li><li>Delete the file. You should delete malicious files such as worms, Trojan horse programs, spyware, or adware programs.</li><li>Periodically review the quarantine folder and delete any files you do not want to recover.</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id="_2-2-4-implementing-malware-protections" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-2-4-implementing-malware-protections"><span>2.2.4 Implementing Malware Protections</span></a></h2><p>Implementing Malware Protections 00:00-00:28 In this demonstration, we&#39;re going to talk about implementing malware protection. This is one of the most important things you can do to increase the overall security of your workstation. Some organizations take care of this with a network-managed solution that protects everyone. The average end user probably isn&#39;t security-minded and may deliberately or accidentally download malware to their workstation. From there, it could spread to your entire network.</p><p>Install Anti-Malware Software 00:28-01:00 Let&#39;s look at installing anti-malware software. Which package you choose is up to you. There are a lot of different packages available, and you can view their rankings on a variety of websites to decide which is best. Windows Security includes general protection for malware, viruses, and security threats. But you may choose to install third-party software to prevent threats on your workstation.</p><p>Today, we&#39;re going to install Malwarebytes. Arguably, it&#39;s one of the best solutions, and there&#39;s a free version. This is the Malwarebytes website, and you can find it by clicking the Free Download button here.</p><p>Configure Malwarebytes 01:00-01:24 We&#39;ll give it a minute to go ahead and download. We&#39;ll quickly run through the setup process now that it&#39;s downloaded. When it launches, it looks something like this. Go ahead and get out of that. Let&#39;s go over to the settings first.</p><p>Current Segment Indicator Malwarebytes Options 01:24-01:58 Let&#39;s come over here, to the Security tab, go down, and look at the options. One option that we&#39;ll want to turn on is scanning for rootkits. We need to make sure that we detect those. Many of these are premium features, but we can still get a significant benefit from the free version.</p><p>Here, on the General tab, let&#39;s go ahead and make sure that we have the latest updates. It tells us that no updates were available, so we&#39;re good to go. We can also specify different types of exclusions in the Allow list. Maybe we don&#39;t want it to scan in a certain file or folder. Generally, we&#39;ll have it scan everything.</p><p>Run a Scan 01:58-02:32 Let&#39;s go ahead and run a scan now. It&#39;ll take a few minutes to do the scan, so we&#39;ll let it run for just a moment. You can see the number of things that it&#39;s scanning and the time that it&#39;s taken.</p><p>First it scans some pre-scan stuff and then goes to memory. It looks at the files later because, of course, if you have some malware that&#39;s sitting in memory, it can manipulate those results locally as the files are scanned. Depending on the file size you have, this can take a long time. Usually, you&#39;ll have this run in the background, so you won&#39;t sit and watch it. We&#39;ll go ahead and pause the demo to let it run.</p><p>Identify Threats 02:32-02:55 Okay, we&#39;re back. We can see that it identified 12 different files as potential threats. What you&#39;ll find is that a bunch of these files aren&#39;t necessarily bad or wrong, they just raise your awareness of what&#39;s on your system. Let&#39;s scroll through them. It looks like we don&#39;t have any major malware, but we do have some potentially unwanted programs. You need to look at those and decide if you want them to be quarantined or not.</p><p>Quarantine 02:55-04:09 It looks like some Chrome extensions are what it&#39;s complaining about. We still don&#39;t exactly know what they are. Let&#39;s save the results to a text file, and we&#39;ll throw that on our desktop. I&#39;ll open it up, and you can see a summary of information, what was scanned, and then you can get a better sense of some of what&#39;s going on.</p><p>We see that the identified threats are related to chrome extensions. I&#39;m going to go ahead and quarantine all of those for now. It&#39;s going to take those files and set them aside in an area where they can&#39;t be activated or used, and that&#39;s referred to as the quarantine. Once that completes, we&#39;ll go over and check those out in the quarantine.</p><p>I get the summary after I complete that process. In order to check what you may have put into quarantine or check detected threats, click on Detection History. This will show you the actively quarantined files and allow you to restore them if you accidently detected a file as a threat.</p><p>Now, of course, if we know for sure we don&#39;t want those, we can simply delete them, and they&#39;ll be permanently removed from the computer. This process of quarantining items can be done automatically, and as such, you can just come in and check on the quarantined items later, based on the best guess of Malwarebytes.</p><p>Best Practices 04:09-04:33 What are some of the best practices for malware scanning? You need to make a trade-off between scanning every single file that comes onto your computer and the amount of extra processing time it would take to do that. I think that I&#39;m fairly careful as an individual, and as such, I just scan, say, once a day. I would suggest scanning once a day and just make sure you do that at a minimum. However, some people like real-time scanning or scanning on a schedule.</p><p>Update Definitions 04:33-04:43 You&#39;ll certainly want to make sure that you&#39;re up to date with your definitions for those malware items, and you&#39;ll want to make sure that, if it&#39;s not automated, you&#39;re checking consistently for new files or definitions.</p><p>Summary 04:43-05:05 That&#39;s it for this demonstration. In this demo, we talked a little bit about the importance of implementing malware protection on your system. Then we looked at the program Malwarebytes, an anti-malware software package that allows you to identify threats, quarantine them, address them, and view reports about what&#39;s been done on your system.</p><h2 id="_2-2-5-use-windows-security" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-2-5-use-windows-security"><span>2.2.5 Use Windows Security</span></a></h2><p>Use Windows Security 00:00-00:44 In this demonstration, we&#39;re going to talk about using Windows Security. Windows Security is a software program Windows provides for free to protect your system from malware, viruses, and security threats. It runs automatically in the background every time Windows is booted. Like any other virus software package, it protects your computer against viruses and other unwanted software on your system. It does this in two ways. First, by providing real-time protection, meaning that it constantly looks for and stops infection attempts. Second, by scanning files on your hard drive to find infections that may already exist.</p><p>History 00:44-00:57 Windows Defender has been around for a while. In Windows 10, it was a separate application, and some of the settings were spread throughout the system. Now this application is an all-in-one console called Window Security.</p><p>Virus and Threat Protection 00:57-02:11 Let&#39;s go ahead and open Windows Security now. We can see there are a few tools that are included with this application. I want to draw your attention to the Virus &amp; threat protection updates. This will tell you the last time Windows security reached out to Microsoft to gather the latest intelligence. Make sure this stays up to date so Windows Security knows about the latest threats.</p><p>We&#39;re going to click Scan options. As you can see, we have several options for scanning. But for now, we&#39;re going to keep it on Quick scan. Let&#39;s start a scan to see if we have any infections. At this time, we don&#39;t have any infections, but we do have some previous infections we can look at. Let&#39;s go to Protection History to view those.</p><p>Here, you can see there are many threats quarantined automatically to protect your system from infection. As we view one of the infections and click Yes on the UAC prompt, it shows us related details, such as what was detected, the date it occurred, and the file location. Let&#39;s click Actions and Remove this threat. Now the status of this threat has been updated to Removed or Restored.</p><p>Exclusions 02:11-02:49 You can also tell Windows Security places where you don&#39;t want to scan or individual files to ignore. Let&#39;s go to Manage Settings in Virus &amp; Threat Protection. Here, there will be several default options that should be on out of the box. Click on Add and remove exclusions. You can see the folder I&#39;ve created called Don&#39;t Scan That.</p><p>We could exclude a file type, a file, a folder, or a certain process that we don&#39;t want Windows Security to look at. In this case, I don&#39;t have anything special or different that I want to exclude, so I&#39;ll go ahead and just leave this as-is.</p><p>Ransomware Protection 02:49-04:05 Okay. We&#39;re going to go ahead and look at ransomware protection. This area is designed to help aid in ransomware attacks on your Windows system. Keep in mind that you may have to adjust settings down the road to allow certain applications access to the folders you&#39;re protecting.</p><p>Let&#39;s say we want to enable this to protect our personal files from ransomware. We have to click the On switch and click Yes on the UAC prompt. Now that this is enabled, let&#39;s take a look at the protected folders. Great. All of our personal folders are automatically added. You also have an option to put additional folders in the list.</p><p>After enabling ransomware protection, we can see Notepad is having issues writing to the Documents folder. Let&#39;s add notepad.exe to the Allowed Apps list. Click on Add an Allowed App. You can either add by recently blocked app or browse for an app. This opens a File Explorer window, and then we&#39;re going to search for notepad.exe on the C:/ drive. We&#39;ll select the Notepad application and open. Now we have Notepad as an allowed app for ransomware protection.</p><p>Firewall &amp; Network Protection 04:05-05:40 Firewall &amp; Network Protection gives an overview of all the settings related to the Windows firewall. Just like any firewall, there are several zones you can configure. By default, Windows has domain network, private network, and public network. Right now, only the public network is active.</p><p>I&#39;m going to look at the area that allows applications through the firewall. Private and Public zones are listed as options. In order to modify any settings in here, elevated permissions are needed. You do this by clicking Change settings. These settings are not grayed out and can be modified. We also have the option to allow another app that may not be listed in the allowed apps.</p><p>For advanced firewall configuration, we&#39;re going to click on Advanced settings. In this area, we can make more detailed changes related to applications. Administrators may have to add rules in the outbound or inbound areas depending on the application. We&#39;re going to take a look at inbound rules, which are related to inbound traffic. There are a lot of rules listed here by default, and they&#39;ll show you what&#39;s allowed for each rule. Outbound rules include some of the same rules, but for outbound traffic. Normal users won&#39;t need to modify these settings, but they&#39;re here in case you&#39;d like to secure your system. If something bad happens with settings or you want to bring everything back to default, you can click Restore firewalls to default.</p><p>App &amp; Browser Control 05:40-06:17 App and browser control provides some extra protection from reputation-based threats or exploits. Let&#39;s click Reputation-based protection. In here, there are several default protection items that protect you from unwanted apps, files, and websites. For now, we&#39;re going to leave the defaults.</p><p>Let&#39;s check out the exploit protection settings. Like reputation-based protection, exploit protection has several options that are automatically on by default. These are protections that prevent cybercriminals from gaining illicit access to the system.</p><p>Device Security 06:17-06:31 Device security contains settings related to the built-in security devices on your system. Some examples are TPM and secure boot. We don&#39;t have either of those set up on this system, so we&#39;ll leave these settings as they are.</p><p>Device Performance and Health 06:31-06:49 Device Performance and Health gives us an overview of the system&#39;s health. As we can see, there are no issues with our system. However, in this area, there is an option to have a fresh start with Windows. This keeps personal files while cleaning the system like a fresh install.</p><p>Family Options 06:49-07:01 The last part here points out that if you have kids and you want to protect them online, you can use Windows Security to set good screen-time habits and look at the types of sites the kids are accessing.</p><p>Summary 07:01-07:12 That&#39;s it for this demonstration. We configured Windows Security and went through some of its basic options.</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div><footer class="vp-page-meta"><!----><div class="vp-meta-item git-info"><div class="vp-meta-item last-updated"><span class="meta-item-label">Last Updated: </span><!----></div><!----></div></footer><nav class="vp-page-nav" aria-label="page navigation"><a class="route-link auto-link prev" href="/security_pro/02/02.01UnderstandingAttacks.html" aria-label="Section 2.1 Understanding Attacks"><div class="hint"><span class="arrow left"></span> Prev</div><div class="link"><span>Section 2.1 Understanding Attacks</span></div></a><a class="route-link auto-link next" href="/security_pro/02/02.03SocialEngineering.html" aria-label="Section 2.3 Social Engineering"><div class="hint">Next <span class="arrow right"></span></div><div class="link"><span>Section 2.3 Social Engineering</span></div></a></nav><!--[--><!--]--></main><!--]--></div><!--[--><!----><!--]--><!--]--></div>
